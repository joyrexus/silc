2	48	461.8	462.83	1.03			
2	48	464.087	466.069	1.982		Does he like it as much now?

2	48	495.238	503.751	8.513		And then when I didn't like it as much we could just save it in case if we just want to read it once in a while	
2	48	503.32	504.97	1.65	Mm-hmm. You could read it to your babies		
2	48	505.3	506.28	0.98

2	24	951.59	953.16	1.57	So can it be a octopus?		
2	24	953.15	954.74	1.59		Actually it's 13	
2	24	955.45	956.75	1.3	So is that an octopus?		
2	24	957.37	957.88	0.51	Nope		
2	24	958.14	958.81	0.67	*laughing*		
2	24	958.63	960.57	1.94		'Cause it's 13, not 8	
2	24	960.54	961.33	0.79	That's right		
2	24	961.33	963.01	1.68		And this is an octopus

2	24	985.04	985.65	0.61		Well

2	24	1008.38	1013.08	4.7		No, usually when I mix up pieces it isn't trickier at all	
2	24	1012.55	1013.51	0.96	*laughing*		
2	24	1013.69	1014.38	0.69	Okay		
2	24	1017.0	1022.92	5.92		But we're just mixing 'em up just in case if this one is a little tricky ###	
2	24	1022.68	1023.66	0.98	It might be		
2	24	1026.16	1029.89	3.73		It might, but I don't think so	
2	24	1031.4	1033.78	2.38		Plus, board puzzles are easy	
2	24	1033.97	1035.41	1.44	What's your hard puzzle?		
2	24	1035.76	1037.12	1.36	What's the hardest one you tried to do?

2	24	1041.01	1042.74	1.73		*laughing* yes	
2	24	1044.89	1048.72	3.83		Yes, that is definitely that one	
2	24	1048.29	1049.64	1.35	I couldn't even do that one		
2	24	1049.75	1050.52	0.77	We had to give up		
2	24	1051.0	1051.77	0.77	*laughing*		
2	24	1051.68	1055.63	3.95		And we had to give it back to grandma before we were even finished	
2	24	1055.42	1056.97	1.55	I know, maybe next year		
2	24	1055.99	1058.65	2.66		Because we would never be finished with it	
2	24	1057.77	1059.04	1.27	Next year you'll be five		
2	24	1059.38	1060.06	0.68	And then maybe		
2	24	1060.92	1062.23	1.31	You can help me more with it		
2	24	1061.04	1062.41	1.37		I'll be better

2	24	1116.24	1117.25	1.01			
2	24	1116.72	1117.65	0.93	*laughing* what		
2	24	1116.93	1118.41	1.48		Puzzles are easy	
2	24	1118.74	1119.98	1.24	Well, not all of 'em		
2	24	1120.98	1123.94	2.96	Even if they're easy they're fun to do, especially when you get a new one, right?		
2	24	1121.02	1121.86	0.84		Well	
2	24	1124.33	1124.95	0.62		Mm-hmm

2	24	1132.5	1133.6	1.1		She said it was new	
2	24	1133.66	1134.24	0.58	Yeah		
2	24	1134.9	1138.94	4.04	And was it, so, she did the farm one, and what one did you do by yourself?		
2	24	1139.09	1139.78	0.69		mmm	
2	24	1140.25	1142.07	1.82		Let me think	
2	24	1143.27	1145.47	2.2		Umm	
2	24	1145.94	1147.32	1.38		Let me think	
2	24	1152.162	1153.845	1.683			
2	24	1153.67	1154.9	1.23	Do you know who that guy is?		
2	24	1156.79	1158.34	1.55	Think of your vitamins		
2	24	1156.93	1157.99	1.06

2	24	1167.04	1170.72	3.68		Wait, am I putting my vitamins in this puzzle?	
2	24	1170.27	1172.07	1.8	*laughs* I think a few of 'em		
2	24	1173.55	1174.26	0.71		Yeah	
2	24	1174.4	1177.73	3.33		Because my vitamin is not a jellyfish	
2	24	1175.889	1177.044	1.155			
2	24	1179.22	1183.85	4.63		And I do not have a octopus vitamin	
2	24	1183.68	1184.36	0.68	That's true		
2	24	1185.459	1187.109	1.65			
2	24	1190.51	1191.51	1.0			
2	24	1193.67	1195.69	2.02		No no, I do not	
2	24	1195.14	1196.64	1.5	So what's that guy? That's the shark?		
2	24	1195.15	1196.11	0.96			
2	24	1196.5	1197.16	0.66		Shark	
2	24	1197.06	1197.61	0.55	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1198.34	1200.55	2.21		And my vitamin	
2	24	1200.22	1201.25	1.03

2	24	1202.15	1202.94	0.79	*laughing*		
2	24	1203.41	1204.75	1.34		*laughing*	
2	24	1207.61	1209.61	2.0		Does this have a regular fish?	
2	24	1209.69	1212.08	2.39	It has a whole bunch. Do you see the shadows of them all?		
2	24	1212.89	1214.97	2.08	Kinda like on our shower curtain, there's all those		
2	24	1215.89	1216.84	0.95	Fish on it		
2	24	1216.56	1217.11	0.55		Yeah

2	24	1223.904	1224.069	0.165			
2	24	1227.44	1228.92	1.48	Is that guy a lobster or a crab?		
2	24	1230.77	1231.44	0.67		Crab	
2	24	1232.54	1234.04	1.5	What's, do you know the difference?		
2	24	1234.59	1238.84	4.25		Because lobsters sometimes go on land, I think	
2	24	1239.52	1240.97	1.45		Do they stay in the water	
2	24	1240.64	1243.42	2.78	I think they stay in the water, unless people catch them to eat them		
2	24	1255.89	1257.01	1.12	What's that part of?		
2	24	1257.4	1258.89	1.49		Jellyfish	
2	24	1258.11	1258.88	0.77	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1259.379	1260.336	0.957

2	24	1278.12	1278.72	0.6		There?

2	24	1279.48	1279.85	0.37		No	
2	24	1280.5	1282.23	1.73		That doesn't go there	
2	24	1283.08	1285.27	2.19		It goes, umm	
2	24	1283.55	1284.85	1.3	Maybe you have to wait		
2	24	1285.79	1287.87	2.08		Yeah, maybe I have to wait	
2	24	1288.24	1289.4	1.16		I'll wait	
2	24	1289.99	1290.93	0.94			
2	24	1291.04	1293.85	2.81		*singing*	
2	24	1294.09	1295.87	1.78	Do you know what these little things are called?		
2	24	1295.63	1296.1	0.47		What

2	24	1302.49	1303.03	0.54	Uh-huh		
2	24	1303.27	1305.97	2.7	In one of our books we- It talks about Barnacles		
2	24	1307.2	1311.08	3.88	They kind of live. They're living things and they live, in the skin, I guess		
2	24	1315.3	1317.92	2.62		Is this swordfish killing the shark?	
2	24	1318.91	1321.02	2.11	Mmm, Does it look like it, or does it look like he's jumping up?		
2	24	1321.254	1322.739	1.485			
2	24	1321.72	1326.94	5.22		It looks like he might be jumping up so that he can try to catch the shark's fin	
2	24	1327.14	1327.73	0.59	Maybe		
2	24	1328.29	1330.19	1.9	The shark looks like he might be pretty fast		
2	24	1328.94	1329.98	1.04

3	24	7.986	8.547	0.561			Researcher Out
3	24	9.49	12.29	2.8	You have to mix all the pieces up, you can't just keep 'em in order.

3	48	593.259	594.617	1.358		Trust me, ###	
3	48	595.504	596.654	1.15	I don't think so		
3	48	600.964	602.698	1.734	And I don't know where this goes		
3	48	603.433	606.211	2.778	Okay, let's just, let's just try putting some parts together		
3	48	603.9	604.263	0.363			
3	48	614.567	618.049	3.482		### When I get my surprise?	
3	48	617.902	620.115	2.213	Well, you have to complete the study first		
3	48	623.786	626.83	3.044	*singing*		
3	48	627.641	629.222	1.581		Nope, don't go	
3	48	628.229	630.238	2.009	*singing*		
3	48	631.938	636.398	4.46	*singing*		
3	48	636.333	638.135	1.802		I need another red	
3	48	639.456	641.024	1.568		Where's some red?	
3	48	641.203	650.468	9.265	*singing/humming*		
3	48	651.414	653.866	2.452	Let's see... Let's put this piece in here		
3	48	654.556	655.529	0.973	No, it doesn't go		
3	48	656.892	658.724	1.832	Does this go? Yeah that goes 		
3	48	656.937	657.308	0.371		But	
3	48	659.84	661.849	2.009	Let's move it over to this side maybe		
3	48	664.043	665.141	1.098	Like that		
3	48	664.917	667.92	3.003			
3	48	665.556	666.14	0.584	Yeah		
3	48	666.556	667.167	0.611	mmkay		
3	48	668.505	670.024	1.519		What's on this ###	
3	48	669.052	671.592	2.54	And I think the butterfly goes down here in the corner		
3	48	672.796	674.1	1.304			
3	48	674.181	674.185	0.004		*singing*	
3	48	674.185	690.109	15.924		*singing*	
3	48	683.505	686.216	2.711			
3	48	688.352	690.91	2.558	No, I don't think that goes; here try this one		
3	48	692.242	696.431	4.189		*singing*	
3	48	692.654	694.654	2.0	Stick the, stick it in there		
3	48	696.38	699.327	2.947	No, that point, in there, try it in there		
3	48	700.779	702.3	1.521		*humming*	
3	48	701.274	703.938	2.664	No, that doesn't go. Let's try another one		
3	48	702.999	704.418	1.419			
3	48	704.286	707.402	3.116		*humming*	
3	48	707.884	709.292	1.408	Let's try this one		
3	48	710.576	711.559	0.983	Stick it in there		
3	48	711.887	712.869	0.982	There we go		
3	48	714.143	714.701	0.558	I think		
3	48	715.72	716.343	0.623		Think yeah	
3	48	716.444	717.825	1.381	Yeah, there we go		
3	48	716.81	718.651	1.841			
3	48	717.836	719.575	1.739		This go right here	
3	48	720.027	721.776	1.749			
3	48	721.248	722.479	1.231	Ooh, good job		
3	48	723.888	724.218	0.33			
3	48	727.798	729.594	1.796	The- I think these stay over this way		
3	48	729.893	730.397	0.504	Like		
3	48	731.946	733.132	1.186	I'm trying to think		
3	48	734.335	737.158	2.823	Does it go, no I think it's got some red, goes over there		
3	48	739.424	741.548	2.124	Like this one, try this one in there		
3	48	742.034	742.972	0.938	In here		
3	48	744.671	745.379	0.708	Yeah		
3	48	746.0	747.283	1.283	And then that goes		
3	48	747.38	748.973	1.593	right here		
3	48	747.869	749.436	1.567			
3	48	749.566	750.654	1.088	good job		
3	48	755.831	756.928	1.097	You think that goes there?		
3	48	757.486	760.229	2.743	I think we need to look for something with leopard spots		
3	48	760.618	761.229	0.611	Let's		
3	48	762.194	764.671	2.477	Let's try to find something with leopard spots		
3	48	768.096	768.954	0.858	No		
3	48	769.583	771.282	1.699	It has to have a flat side though		
3	48	775.645	777.698	2.053	This puzzle is more challenging		
3	48	776.952	778.272	1.32			
3	48	779.388	780.167	0.779	Good job		
3	48	783.954	784.937	0.983	Maybe it goes here?		
3	48	787.574	788.308	0.734	Maybe		
3	48	788.839	789.468	0.629	Maybe		
3	48	790.229	791.114	0.885	No		
3	48	791.536	792.362	0.826		No?	
3	48	792.956	794.985	2.029		But it have green right here	
3	48	794.575	797.061	2.486	Yeah, but it's a little different; let's try this one		
3	48	797.898	800.318	2.42		It's already sticked	
3	48	798.681	799.407	0.726	I got it		
3	48	799.84	800.304	0.464	mm-mm		
3	48	801.115	802.23	1.115		mm-hmm	
3	48	801.725	804.203	2.478	Let's try that one. No, turn it around		
3	48	805.636	806.486	0.85	Like this		
3	48	809.415	811.716	2.301	No, I don't think that, that doesn't go either		
3	48	812.654	813.743	1.089	Oh, wow		
3	48	814.23	815.477	1.247	How about this one?		
3	48	815.778	817.087	1.309	Did we try that one already?		
3	48	818.087	818.521	0.434	No		
3	48	819.666	821.869	2.203		I think we goes right	
3	48	821.034	822.804	1.77	Where's the ant's head?		
3	48	825.782	827.913	2.131		I don't have no ant head	
3	48	831.202	832.362	1.16		*sigh*	
3	48	833.893	836.017	2.124	Okay, this goes here		
3	48	835.39	836.535	1.145			
3	48	838.619	841.645	3.026	Let's try to finish the rest of the butterfly, then maybe we can		
3	48	840.39	841.723	1.333			
3	48	843.129	844.433	1.304			
3	48	846.557	847.946	1.389	No, this goes with the bird		
3	48	850.229	851.238	1.009	So that's the beak		
3	48	853.432	855.353	1.921	Now let's see where it goes with the bird		
3	48	855.698	857.388	1.69	It goes, I think maybe somewhere		
3	48	860.681	863.575	2.894	Mm-mm. That doesn't look right		
3	48	867.982	870.061	2.079	I know this goes down here		
3	48	868.912	870.246	1.334			
3	48	872.912	876.115	3.203		### Seconds	
3	48	872.937	875.459	2.522	How about this? Try this one here		
3	48	878.739	880.188	1.449			
3	48	880.22	881.158	0.938	Mmkay		
3	48	881.724	884.868	3.144		I want my four seconds	
3	48	884.406	885.76	1.354	I don't think that goes there		
3	48	888.694	891.027	2.333		Nope. Try the other one	
3	48	890.521	892.035	1.514	This goes here		
3	48	892.853	893.375	0.522		Yup	
3	48	893.636	894.679	1.043		Goes right here	
3	48	895.448	896.592	1.144			
3	48	895.459	895.973	0.514	Now		
3	48	897.81	904.694	6.884		Ooh I think this goes right here	
3	48	901.056	902.65	1.594			
3	48	905.274	906.404	1.13			
3	48	905.556	906.3	0.744	mm-mm		
3	48	906.273	907.012	0.739		No	
3	48	908.186	911.794	3.608		*whining*	
3	48	911.91	912.794	0.884		red	
3	48	914.36	917.78	3.42		*whining*	
3	48	918.099	918.736	0.637		No	
3	48	920.898	921.391	0.493		###	
3	48	930.865	932.255	1.39	Mm-mm don't bang it		
3	48	937.578	938.318	0.74		*whining*	
3	48	939.238	942.079	2.841	No, that doesn't fit; you can't force it to fit		
3	48	943.637	944.725	1.088	That doesn't go there		
3	48	945.999	947.415	1.416	Let's look for something with a leaf		
3	48	950.556	951.928	1.372	Are we missing a piece?		
3	48	953.91	955.804	1.894	Did a piece fall off ###		
3	48	956.934	957.693	0.759		Hmm	
3	48	957.795	958.282	0.487	No		
3	48	963.864	964.26	0.396			
3	48	968.724	969.97	1.246			
3	48	969.548	970.896	1.348		Where's this go?	
3	48	971.379	972.211	0.832	I don't know		
3	48	973.283	975.221	1.938	I think it goes over here. Maybe		
3	48	976.769	977.185	0.416	No		
3	48	978.318	979.875	1.557	Oh, up here. Try it up here		
3	48	979.301	981.214	1.913		It's move ###	
3	48	981.211	982.158	0.947	Nope, this way		
3	48	985.289	986.376	1.087			
3	48	985.946	986.928	0.982	There we go		
3	48	988.054	990.88	2.826		Okay

3	48	1001.694	1002.781	1.087			
3	48	1002.804	1004.512	1.708	Don't get frustrated, it's okay		
3	48	1005.839	1008.423	2.584	Let's try, let's try this piece down there		
3	48	1008.636	1009.556	0.92	Try that piece		
3	48	1010.027	1011.013	0.986

3	48	1017.601	1019.504	1.903	How about we try this piece right there		
3	48	1023.3	1025.406	2.106	Does it go? No it doesn't fit		
3	48	1026.535	1027.549	1.014		No	
3	48	1026.699	1028.097	1.398	Let's try another piece

3	48	1047.361	1048.463	1.102			
3	48	1051.072	1053.144	2.072		So I can get my surprise	
3	48	1057.274	1058.535	1.261

3	48	1083.716	1085.831	2.115	This goes over here somewhere		
3	48	1087.327	1089.955	2.628	Try it here, but I don't think it goes there		
3	48	1090.522	1094.026	3.504	Ooh, we have it wrong, we have to move this down		
3	48	1093.999	1095.057	1.058			
3	48	1095.787	1096.353	0.566	Now

3	48	1117.264	1119.477	2.213	Look for the colors; look for the same colors		
3	48	1121.485	1123.317	1.832	So like where do you think this one goes?		
3	48	1125.087	1125.715	0.628	good

4	48	19.62	20.19	0.57		Break	
4	48	20.72	24.95	4.23		I wanna do these parts. These parts is easy for me	
4	48	24.37	25.87	1.5	Well you gotta take it apart, first

4	48	533.65	534.89	1.24		This could fit here	
4	48	536.01	538.5	2.49		it fit ## somewhere else	
4	48	537.89	538.31	0.42	Hmm		
4	48	539.946	540.078	0.132			
4	48	539.98	541.17	1.19	I wonder where those go		
4	48	541.61	542.49	0.88	Can you figure it out?		
4	48	542.32	542.99	0.67		Yeah	
4	48	543.18	544.51	1.33	Oh this looks like part of the snake		
4	48	544.87	545.62	0.75		Snake	
4	48	545.01	545.61	0.6	Up there		
4	48	547.06	550.8	3.74	Um, I think, look 'cause it's on the edge.  See where that's a flat edge?		
4	48	551.38	552.69	1.31	I think it goes up here somewhere		
4	48	555.56	556.26	0.7		Oh!	
4	48	556.4	556.88	0.48	*gasp*		
4	48	556.82	561.4	4.58		It fits right here, but it, it's not going because I have to move it	
4	48	561.3	564.44	3.14	You don't have to move it, you just have to pop it in there like a click		
4	48	565.62	566.55	0.93			
4	48	566.5	567.02	0.52	There		
4	48	567.11	567.54	0.43		*laughing*	
4	48	567.6	568.2	0.6	*laughing*		
4	48	568.01	568.8	0.79		Pop it	
4	48	568.7	569.84	1.14	Just pop it right in there		
4	48	570.5	570.84	0.34	Oh		
4	48	571.33	572.62	1.29	It looks like that might go next to it		
4	48	572.077	591.36	19.283		*noises*	
4	48	574.3	575.44	1.14	No, over by the snake		
4	48	582.03	583.07	1.04			
4	48	591.74	595.06	3.32		Oh, it's not fitting, ooh	
4	48	592.67	594.19	1.52			
4	48	594.66	595.58	0.92	Get it in		
4	48	596.14	596.9	0.76			
4	48	596.94	597.46	0.52	*gasp*		
4	48	597.03	597.57	0.54		###	
4	48	598.03	598.49	0.46		Oh	
4	48	599.7	603.35	3.65		This puzzle right here, this puzzle round	
4	48	607.19	609.95	2.76		This, how I turn this ###	
4	48	609.76	611.28	1.52	I think maybe it goes by the snake		
4	48	612.47	614.68	2.21		I go by the snake	
4	48	614.46	614.89	0.43	*gasp*		
4	48	614.59	615.51	0.92			
4	48	615.15	616.15	1.0	You did it!		
4	48	617.33	619.49	2.16		It goes like that, monkeys go like that	
4	48	618.057	619.113	1.056			
4	48	619.37	620.12	0.75	Woo hoo!		
4	48	620.37	621.17	0.8		I did it	
4	48	621.98	622.78	0.8	mmhmm		
4	48	622.51	623.35	0.84		I helped you	
4	48	623.31	624.68	1.37	You helped me, you're right		
4	48	626.84	629.12	2.28		And this piece might go somewhere else	
4	48	629.41	633.16	3.75	You know what, lookit. See how it has flat edge, it means it goes up here somewhere		
4	48	633.27	634.22	0.95		Oh yeah	
4	48	634.51	635.68	1.17		You're right, Mom!	
4	48	635.85	636.55	0.7	*gasps*		
4	48	637.38	640.05	2.67	Oh you almost had it. You gotta put the flat edge in the top		
4	48	642.0	642.84	0.84	Turn it around		
4	48	643.15	643.96	0.81	Yeah, there you go		
4	48	644.27	645.87	1.6	Tur- No, look, look		
4	48	646.2	646.69	0.49	See?		
4	48	647.07	648.73	1.66	The flat edge goes by the flat edge		
4	48	649.46	650.98	1.52	And then I think those fit together		
4	48	651.25	652.02	0.77			
4	48	651.67	652.19	0.52	*gasp*		
4	48	654.01	654.78	0.77	Woohoo		
4	48	655.33	656.73	1.4		And where does this piece go?	
4	48	657.23	657.74	0.51	mmm		
4	48	658.98	663.15	4.17	That does not have a flat edge, so it doesn't go up there. But this one goes right here		
4	48	662.67	663.37	0.7			
4	48	663.61	665.85	2.24	And then I think this is the last edge piece		
4	48	667.491	668.382	0.891			
4	48	667.83	669.51	1.68	Can you get it in there? Woo!		
4	48	669.01	669.41	0.4		Uh	
4	48	670.51	673.63	3.12		And where does this flat edge go?	
4	48	674.4	676.01	1.61	Only a couple more pieces		
4	48	676.93	677.46	0.53	Look		
4	48	677.16	679.48	2.32		It goes to this!	
4	48	679.47	680.757	1.287			
4	48	679.49	679.92	0.43	*gasp*		
4	48	680.31	681.25	0.94	I got that one		
4	48	681.53	682.47	0.94	Parrot		
4	48	683.48	685.33	1.85	Uhh, Try it- Scoot it over that way		
4	48	688.05	689.03	0.98	Oh, you know what?		
4	48	689.7	691.06	1.36	Oh, maybe it goes down here somewhere		
4	48	693.71	698.25	4.54	Like maybe this one. Oh look, yeah, them leaves match up right there		
4	48	700.26	701.679	1.419			
4	48	700.34	701.87	1.53	Those are kinda hard to push in there, right?		
4	48	703.692	705.111	1.419			
4	48	707.24	711.22	3.98		There's a piece missing right here	
4	48	710.54	711.83	1.29	Mm-hmm, What do we think that one is?		
4	48	712.83	713.42	0.59	Try this one?		
4	48	714.93	715.76	0.83	Hurry		
4	48	716.18	717.53	1.35	Almost done, almost done!		
4	48	719.63	720.58	0.95			
4	48	721.39	724.37	2.98	Yep. Oh look, I think that one slides right into there		
4	48	725.17	726.43	1.26	Wait, it was right		
4	48	726.62	727.73	1.11	Put it right, right there		
4	48	728.38	730.12	1.74	Pop it in. See where it matches up?		
4	48	729.68	731.57	1.89			
4	48	732.07	733.92	1.85	Look, one more piece!		
4	48	736.96	737.53	0.57		###	
4	48	739.4	741.3	1.9	Mmm, Might have to turn it around		
4	48	743.74	744.7	0.96			
4	48	744.249	744.711	0.462			48 Piece - End
4	24	791.835	792.132	0.297			24 Piece - Start
4	24	792.33	793.64	1.31		Ooh	
4	24	793.79	794.51	0.72	Alright		
4	24	796.83	797.64	0.81		Yeah	
4	24	798.52	800.24	1.72		Now break it apart!	
4	24	798.765	799.095	0.33			Researcher Out
4	24	800.17	801.2	1.03	### it apart		
4	24	804.64	805.51	0.87		Rah!	
4	24	806.19	808.15	1.96		Stupid butts!	
4	24	808.46	809.02	0.56	No		
4	24	809.55	810.36	0.81	Don't say that		
4	24	811.7	813.69	1.99		I'm building an ###	
4	24	814.45	816.53	2.08		See these ones will go down there	
4	24	817.02	819.53	2.51		###	
4	24	821.01	822.97	1.96	Oh, was that already put together?		
4	24	823.45	824.32	0.87		Yeah	
4	24	824.45	825.55	1.1	You're a cheater		
4	24	825.52	828.5	2.98		I I I ###	
4	24	829.04	829.46	0.42	Wha-		
4	24	829.06	832.75	3.69		I I I, Can you push me in?	
4	24	832.69	833.25	0.56	Mm-hmm		
4	24	833.05	837.36	4.31		Slide me in *noises*	
4	24	838.1	841.35	3.25		How do we know this puzzle is a shark	
4	24	842.22	844.85	2.63		This puzzle's kind of noisy	
4	24	845.68	846.2	0.52	Yeah		
4	24	848.59	851.06	2.47		How about this one goes, like, here	
4	24	850.55	850.98	0.43	*gasp*		
4	24	851.928	852.093	0.165			
4	24	851.93	852.64	0.71		Got it	
4	24	852.48	855.87	3.39	Do you think maybe we should turn it around though? 'Cause it looks like he's upside down		
4	24	858.45	862.47	4.02	Well no, not the whole thing, just the- Here, like maybe it goes this way		
4	24	863.41	864.24	0.83	I think		
4	24	865.29	866.98	1.69	Here's another piece of the octopus		
4	24	868.57	871.14	2.57	And, is that another piece? *gasp*		
4	24	869.37	871.8	2.43		A sucker. It's a sucky	
4	24	872.72	874.53	1.81		It's called a sucker winner	
4	24	874.24	875.97	1.73	Should we watch Elf when we get home?		
4	24	876.23	876.6	0.37		No	
4	24	876.93	877.48	0.55	No?		
4	24	878.23	878.66	0.43		Why	
4	24	879.3	880.62	1.32		Why should we watch Elf?	
4	24	880.81	884.26	3.45	I don't know, because it's so funny and you keep talking about it, it makes me want to watch it		
4	24	885.84	888.37	2.53		*noises*	
4	24	885.9	887.37	1.47			
4	24	887.7	888.6	0.9	Did you figure that one out?		
4	24	888.9	890.0	1.1	I think- *gasp*		
4	24	890.769	891.957	1.188			
4	24	892.13	893.14	1.01	Good job		
4	24	893.6	896.67	3.07	Here's another part of it. I think these two both go with it, too		
4	24	900.86	902.01	1.15		It's a big butt	
4	24	901.03	902.82	1.79	What does he say when he goes in the-		
4	24	903.27	905.46	2.19	"In the mailroom, right? He says ""It's a sucky thing"""		
4	24	906.28	908.08	1.8	When the mail thing sucks up the mail		
4	24	910.13	911.46	1.33	Is that what you were trying to talk about?		
4	24	911.94	912.42	0.48		Yeah	
4	24	913.35	916.56	3.21		He sucks up, sucks up the ###	
4	24	916.24	917.73	1.49	It's so sucky, right?		
4	24	918.59	919.71	1.12		So sucky	
4	24	920.44	921.89	1.45		This thing is so sucky	
4	24	922.72	923.23	0.51		Sucky	
4	24	922.8	924.16	1.36	Here, I think that goes underneath it		
4	24	924.49	925.92	1.43		*noises*	
4	24	925.96	927.77	1.81	Look, I have a crab almost done		
4	24	929.31	929.98	0.67		Crab	
4	24	932.49	935.22	2.73	Oh yeah I think if you turn it around you might fit that one in there		
4	24	936.25	936.63	0.38		Yeah	
4	24	936.7	937.13	0.43	*gasp*		
4	24	938.16	941.12	2.96	Ooh, you're so smart		
4	24	940.86	942.77	1.91		What ###	
4	24	942.15	945.36	3.21	I think it might've- I think it might go right next to this		
4	24	943.338	944.262	0.924			
4	24	946.13	946.78	0.65		Yeah	
4	24	946.18	946.97	0.79	You think?		
4	24	949.12	950.76	1.64	Oh, slide it in there		
4	24	949.65	952.74	3.09			
4	24	953.96	954.91	0.95	Whoa		
4	24	955.86	959.81	3.95		*noises*	
4	24	956.2	957.68	1.48	That is so cool		
4	24	960.59	962.58	1.99		Look at what we did	
4	24	962.28	965.7	3.42	Look, I think this is the jellyfish or something		
4	24	962.48	963.59	1.11			
4	24	965.28	968.1	2.82		Jellyfish. Ooh and	
4	24	967.45	968.49	1.04	Oh, look		
4	24	968.98	971.64	2.66	You have to get the mouth of the shark right next to where you just had it		
4	24	971.916	972.081	0.165			
4	24	973.12	973.98	0.86	Right there, yep		
4	24	976.55	977.79	1.24			
4	24	977.39	978.21	0.82	Hmm		
4	24	979.27	979.84	0.57		Jelly	
4	24	982.74	983.72	0.98		Jellyfish	
4	24	985.01	985.48	0.47	*gasp*		
4	24	985.776	986.832	1.056	###		
4	24	987.33	988.49	1.16		*noises*	
4	24	990.02	991.84	1.82	And this goes somewhere in there, too		
4	24	991.22	992.81	1.59		This is a big man	
4	24	993.28	994.54	1.26	I forget what that's called		
4	24	998.15	999.53	1.38		Think that goes right there	
4	24	999.52	1000.03	0.51	*gasp*		
4	24	1000.65	1001.65	1.0	Woo hoo!		
4	24	1002.49	1004.08	1.59		And where does this piece go?	
4	24	1005.09	1008.55	3.46	I dunno, mmm, maybe, maybe down here somewhere		
4	24	1009.51	1011.51	2.0	And I think this one goes right up-		
4	24	1012.27	1012.86	0.59	Uh		
4	24	1013.39	1014.05	0.66		No!	
4	24	1013.6	1014.87	1.27	Oh, maybe it goes right there!		
4	24	1014.57	1015.76	1.19			
4	24	1015.04	1018.11	3.07		No, it's gonna make two sharks if we went right here	
4	24	1018.51	1020.9	2.39	*gasp* Look, I think this all slides back together		
4	24	1021.66	1022.7	1.04	Slide it on over		
4	24	1022.571	1024.155	1.584			
4	24	1024.155	1025.541	1.386			
4	24	1025.5	1026.01	0.51	*gasp*		
4	24	1026.36	1027.08	0.72	Oh my gosh		
4	24	1027.2	1028.45	1.25	We are so smart		
4	24	1028.86	1030.1	1.24		Yes, we are	
4	24	1032.41	1033.61	1.2			
4	24	1033.45	1035.06	1.61		This goes right here	
4	24	1034.52	1035.51	0.99	Good job		
4	24	1036.78	1037.93	1.15	I think		
4	24	1038.66	1040.19	1.53	This might be that corner over there		
4	24	1042.94	1044.35	1.41			
4	24	1044.17	1045.66	1.49		That's where I want it to fit in	
4	24	1045.59	1046.93	1.34	Mmkay where do you think that one goes?		
4	24	1047.76	1050.0	2.24		*noises*	
4	24	1050.82	1053.53	2.71		This, I don't know how this goes	
4	24	1055.01	1057.32	2.31	Oh I think you had it right, look at where the edge is		
4	24	1060.02	1061.06	1.04	Look at where the edge is		
4	24	1062.26	1065.19	2.93	See where the straight parts are, and where the straight part of the puzzle is?		
4	24	1068.38	1070.22	1.84	That thing is going on again, what is that?		
4	24	1075.92	1078.77	2.85	*laughing* What is it-It's part of that over there		
4	24	1079.95	1081.57	1.62	I think it's part of the heat or something

13	48	517.143	517.539	0.396		Mmm	
13	48	518.298	519.255	0.957	It's got an edge, right?

13	48	547.932	550.209	2.277	Let's wait on this. I don't think it fits there, NAME		
13	48	550.836	554.07	3.234	'Cause we need something with darker green that's got ####		
13	48	554.499	555.918	1.419		Dark and green?	
13	48	555.918	556.908	0.99	Darker green		
13	48	557.898	558.558	0.66		This one?	
13	48	558.822	564.861	6.039	It is darker green. Alright. What- What else do you think this, corner piece is?		
13	48	564.96	566.61	1.65		It, This!	
13	48	567.039	567.6	0.561	####

13	48	569.184	572.154	2.97	Mmm I don't know about that. Well, try it out		
13	48	574.233	576.312	2.079	Alright. We need a corner up here		
13	48	577.467	578.424	0.957	Can you find a corner?		
13	48	580.602	582.978	2.376	That looks like a corner. Let's put that in, does it fit there?		
13	48	583.209	584.661	1.452			
13	48	584.529	585.387	0.858		Yes	
13	48	585.024	590.964	5.94	It kinda looks like it might go. So I think we need a piece right here with an edge, and some red, and some green		
13	48	592.02	592.977	0.957	Let's take a look at the colors, hon		
13	48	593.703	603.075	9.372	Red, red, That one's got green. It needs an edge- So let's look at the edge pieces. That's an edge with red and green. You are right about that. It doesn't fit there, right?		
13	48	593.736	594.363	0.627		Green!	
13	48	603.405	604.164	0.759		Right

13	48	620.664	622.182	1.518	I think that's the way to go		
13	48	622.875	624.591	1.716			
13	48	623.106	624.789	1.683		Has a snake too!

13	48	633.798	636.24	2.442	What do you think? What should we do next? Should we do the edges?		
13	48	636.075	637.197	1.122		This one goes right-	
13	48	637.494	638.187	0.693	Does it?

13	48	641.124	643.467	2.343		Where's this one go? It goes right here?	
13	48	643.335	647.724	4.389	That looks like it does. Do you wanna do the one that goes next to it? More brown?		
13	48	643.5	645.447	1.947			
13	48	650.034	650.991	0.957		This one?

15	24	73.062	74.547	1.485	Let's get closer together		
15	24	74.481	75.834	1.353		###	
15	24	75.9	76.725	0.825	Watch your feet		
15	24	79.596	85.47	5.874	How 'bout, how 'bout corner pieces? These pieces go in the corner, look at, 'cause they're corner pieces		
15	24	86.163	87.252	1.089		That piece...	
15	24	87.945	89.925	1.98	I think it goes up here, I think so		
15	24	92.004	92.334	0.33		Ooh	
15	24	92.169	97.152	4.983	Ooh, NAME, look at that, pink and pink, I think, if you put it in the corner-		
15	24	98.274	103.257	4.983	Yeah, NAME, that's it, but because it's a corner piece I think it goes like this, I, NAME look		
15	24	103.851	105.303	1.452			
15	24	103.884	105.666	1.782	I think it goes like this what do you think?		
15	24	106.491	110.88	4.389	I think so NAME, *gasp* Ooh, NAME you're getting it, what other pink pieces are there?		
15	24	107.151	108.57	1.419			
15	24	114.477	118.371	3.894	'Kay, You're right, Okay, That's right, You did it		
15	24	115.533	117.051	1.518			
15	24	119.295	125.499	6.204	Now which one? There was an eye, I wonder if we could find another part of the eye and it has to be a corner piece. Ooh-		
15	24	125.73	126.753	1.023		It's a shark	
15	24	126.423	127.578	1.155			
15	24	128.469	130.185	1.716	I think so I think you're right		
15	24	137.049	141.603	4.554	Ah, I don't think so, 'cause is there anything that looks like this in this picture right here? Not that one		
15	24	142.428	143.484	1.056	I don't think that goes		
15	24	144.309	144.771	0.462		Umm	
15	24	145.728	146.85	1.122	Let's try another color		
15	24	147.906	149.886	1.98		Where this ###	
15	24	149.589	153.318	3.729	Can I tell you something? I think it has to be straight 'cause this is straight		
15	24	155.925	157.806	1.881		It's supposed to go	
15	24	157.971	158.895	0.924	How 'bout this one?		
15	24	160.182	162.096	1.914		I already tried that piece	
15	24	161.766	165.264	3.498	Okay, so let's get another straight piece. You think it's this piece?		
15	24	167.079	168.564	1.485		Not fitting!	
15	24	168.465	173.844	5.379	Okay, don't get mad, so let's try another straight piece. Umm, this piece?		
15	24	177.144	179.256	2.112		Not fitting!	
15	24	177.672	178.464	0.792	Okay		
15	24	179.322	182.886	3.564	Okay, *gasp* I know, how 'bout this piece?		
15	24	179.949	180.114	0.165			
15	24	184.701	187.374	2.673	I think that one fits *gasp* I think you got it		
15	24	185.922	187.374	1.452			
15	24	187.935	191.73	3.795	Lookit I think that's a whale. Do you think it's a whale or do you think it's a shark?		
15	24	191.73	193.182	1.452		I think it's a shark	
15	24	193.71	195.591	1.881	I think it's a whale. I wonder # 		
15	24	195.228	196.812	1.584		### find out	
15	24	198.495	200.343	1.848		Maybe ###	
15	24	199.485	200.607	1.122	That's a straight piece		
15	24	201.333	203.082	1.749	So straight pieces go along this way		
15	24	204.039	204.468	0.429	###		
15	24	210.21	213.576	3.366	I don't think it goes there. I think we need blue for that blue		
15	24	216.513	231.858	15.345	I don't think it's that, Ooh is it that blue? I don't think so, NAME you know why? Lookit right here, it doesn't fit. Maybe this is the piece though. I think actually you're right. You know why? Look at this. This is the fin, and then this is the purple part		
15	24	216.942	218.262	1.32			
15	24	234.465	238.458	3.993	But, this is all straight, we all have to find straight pieces or corner pieces that go there		
15	24	239.481	242.715	3.234	So these aren't straight, this isn't straight		
15	24	243.639	245.817	2.178	How bout this one, this one's a straight one		
15	24	243.804	244.695	0.891		Oh yeah	
15	24	246.741	248.721	1.98		These pieces are straight!	
15	24	248.226	252.714	4.488	You know what we'll do? We'll separate the straight pieces so we can make- oh, here, let me ###		
15	24	253.44	253.968	0.528	you sit		
15	24	255.387	255.981	0.594	Okay		
15	24	255.849	257.4	1.551		Put me more closer	
15	24	257.301	257.862	0.561	Okay		
15	24	260.337	262.581	2.244	Let's get the straight pieces first		
15	24	263.703	268.389	4.686	Let's put all the other pieces away so that this can help us		
15	24	269.841	277.497	7.656	This is a straight piece, this is a straight piece, straight piece, straight piece, corner piece, straight piece, straight piece, corner, straight		
15	24	279.642	281.061	1.419	This is not		
15	24	283.074	285.153	2.079		Maybe, it go right here	
15	24	286.077	287.892	1.815		Maybe try to...	
15	24	288.09	293.271	5.181	Maybe that one, 'cause it's orange, goes over here by itself 'cause there's nothing else that's orange right now		
15	24	293.667	295.614	1.947	Let's try and leave it there and see what happens		
15	24	296.043	297.132	1.089		This is orange	
15	24	297.198	297.924	0.726	Okay		
15	24	299.013	302.049	3.036	It's straight though, so I think it either goes here or here		
15	24	299.904	300.069	0.165			
15	24	303.798	304.491	0.693		Find out	
15	24	305.052	306.273	1.221	Okay, let's see		
15	24	305.943	307.527	1.584		Find out!	
15	24	307.56	308.913	1.353	Ooh, I think you're doing it		
15	24	309.738	311.388	1.65		Find out	
15	24	311.322	313.17	1.848	I think you're doing it NAME		
15	24	312.906	314.457	1.551		Find out	
15	24	320.661	322.74	2.079	How about NAME can I show you something?		
15	24	323.763	331.683	7.92	I think this is a- a corner piece, look at, 'cause it's gotta be two straight pieces right here, one piece, two piece, I think maybe this one goes there		
15	24	332.409	334.257	1.848	But you can try it- you can tell Mommy		
15	24	336.666	340.56	3.894	I think you're doing it, and then you go right there, okay, so		
15	24	346.038	348.282	2.244		Aww, we forgot a piece	
15	24	348.15	348.909	0.759	We did?		
15	24	349.569	350.031	0.462		Yeah	
15	24	350.724	351.252	0.528		Oh yeah	
15	24	351.153	352.572	1.419	What piece do you think we forgot?		
15	24	353.397	354.75	1.353		It's supposed to be ###	
15	24	354.024	355.212	1.188	You think, is this one here?		
15	24	355.905	356.73	0.825	There you go		
15	24	366.564	367.983	1.419	Did we put the wrong piece in there?		
15	24	369.072	369.765	0.693	Don't get mad		
15	24	370.689	371.613	0.924		I'm not getting-	
15	24	370.689	373.527	2.838	Aah, did we maybe put the wrong piece- Let's see		
15	24	372.273	374.253	1.98			
15	24	373.923	376.2	2.277	Put that there, let's try something		
15	24	380.061	381.315	1.254	Oh, I think that one goes there		
15	24	382.338	383.295	0.957			
15	24	382.965	384.417	1.452		Now we're connecting it	
15	24	384.285	389.928	5.643	Okay how about this one? This one, orange and brown, that's straight, that goes there		
15	24	387.816	388.806	0.99			
15	24	389.763	391.149	1.386		It's connects!	
15	24	390.885	402.27	11.385	Okay, Ooh, How about this one in the corner, I think it goes in the corner, I think if you t- no this one here, in this corner, 'cause it's got two straight pieces, that's that doesn't have two straight pieces		
15	24	404.712	406.098	1.386		Maybe this piece	
15	24	406.527	407.748	1.221			
15	24	407.649	408.969	1.32	Oh that's right, you did it		
15	24	411.444	412.863	1.419			
15	24	411.84	412.368	0.528		*noises*	
15	24	413.061	417.846	4.785	You did it again! I think we got one more straight piece to put, and then we can put the middle inside		
15	24	418.671	419.76	1.089			
15	24	419.826	428.274	8.448	Okay, Now, let's see where our colors are, we have orange, purple, blue, blue		
15	24	423.423	424.512	1.089		This is ###-	
15	24	430.089	432.3	2.211		You said this was blue	
15	24	431.409	435.501	4.092	No, this is orange, I think orange goes over here, NAME, and purple		
15	24	436.59	437.976	1.386		Oh it's not fitting	
15	24	438.207	439.263	1.056	Not fitting?		
15	24	439.758	443.85	4.092	Can I see something? Let me see if this one fits. Can I see if this one fits?		
15	24	444.741	445.104	0.363	Mm		
15	24	446.919	449.295	2.376			
15	24	447.315	455.664	8.349	I think that one fits, because it's purple and orange, that piece had purple in it, and this has orange in it and so does that and that fits, that's right		
15	24	457.776	461.802	4.026	And, are you sure that one goes there?		
15	24	463.056	464.706	1.65		Sure this one goes there?	
15	24	464.871	466.29	1.419	I don't think so		
15	24	466.785	468.996	2.211		Oh, this one goes right here?	
15	24	470.382	473.979	3.597	I don't think so 'cause you have to put it with the- Ooh there you go		
15	24	471.504	472.791	1.287			
15	24	474.507	475.827	1.32			
15	24	475.53	477.279	1.749	Wow, and how 'bout this piece here?		
15	24	478.434	480.348	1.914	Well there's no orange over here, NAME		
15	24	480.81	482.493	1.683	Think there's orange over here though		
15	24	483.648	484.704	1.056			
15	24	485.166	486.387	1.221	Oh you did it		
15	24	486.849	487.872	1.023		Almost done	
15	24	487.905	489.753	1.848	Mm-hmm you're almost done, NAME		
15	24	491.469	493.416	1.947		And then we're doing a different puzzle	
15	24	493.251	495.429	2.178	I think so, I think they have us doing one more puzzle		
15	24	496.452	498.201	1.749	Uhh, where does this one go, NAME?		
15	24	499.026	500.874	1.848		I know where this one goes

15	24	501.864	504.108	2.244	Oh my god, you do know where that goes		
15	24	504.636	508.893	4.257		*noises*	
15	24	504.702	505.989	1.287	And where do you think that one goes?		
15	24	514.998	524.139	9.141	Do you wanna turn it around? I think was- well it- It's a shark, so i- I think that's part of the shark's eye, that's his yellow, and there's yellow, so I think you have to turn it around		
15	24	525.03	525.921	0.891		Like this?	
15	24	525.789	530.541	4.752	I think so, You can try it and see if it happens. Oh, I think you're right, and this one?		
15	24	527.472	528.891	1.419			
15	24	530.508	532.389	1.881		And then last piece we'll do	
15	24	531.795	533.181	1.386			
15	24	532.752	533.214	0.462			24 Piece - End
15	48	567.864	568.095	0.231			48 Piece - Start
15	48	570.042	575.091	5.049	It's a jungle, It's sort of like the rainforest cafe. Okay, so, we have to do it		
15	48	577.071	578.259	1.188	Let's make it a mess		
15	48	577.731	580.206	2.475		These are so little pieces	
15	48	580.14	582.978	2.838	Oh my goodness. Do you think we're gonna do it or do you think it's gonna be too hard?		
15	48	584.43	587.037	2.607		Oops, ### we dropped a piece	
15	48	586.608	587.301	0.693	That's okay

15	48	595.419	596.145	0.726	Okay		
15	48	596.937	603.042	6.105	This one might be a little bit harder, NAME, so we have to turn them around, turn all the pieces around, separate them		
15	48	605.847	607.992	2.145	We gotta do all the straight pieces first, right?		
15	48	612.612	613.965	1.353	Okay, so NAME?		
15	48	614.79	617.001	2.211	Do you want me to take out the straight pieces for you first?

15	48	647.658	651.321	3.663	I don't think, that piece doesn't work, because, well but you know what? Let's let's do the other-		
15	48	652.641	657.492	4.851	Let's do the square pieces first, the ones that have straight lines, and then we'll put everything in the inside		
15	48	659.175	661.782	2.607	Isn't that how you do it? That's how we do it at home, with Daddy		
15	48	662.871	663.663	0.792	Okay

15	48	696.201	698.148	1.947		He goes...	
15	48	697.983	700.26	2.277	You think he goes there? Or you think he goes all the way over there?		
15	48	701.778	703.23	1.452	### Yeah I think you're right		
15	48	704.319	705.672	1.353	Did we drop some pieces?		
15	48	708.312	708.708	0.396	Okay		
15	48	709.599	711.15	1.551		I- I was gonna get it	
15	48	711.051	711.876	0.825	Oh I'm sorry		
15	48	712.701	713.361	0.66		Okay	
15	48	712.701	714.615	1.914	'Kay, come on. Get closer		
15	48	716.826	717.684	0.858	Okay		
15	48	721.413	729.102	7.689	Let's do the- Let's do the straight pieces first, look at this piece, it's not straight, we gotta do all the border first, this is called a border		
15	48	732.006	736.89	4.884	So let's put this over here. So what other straight piece, what- what other one has a corner like this one does?		
15	48	742.005	742.5	0.495		Nope	
15	48	747.879	748.143	0.264

15	48	752.796	755.799	3.003	Lookit this one has a corner. You think this one goes here?		
15	48	757.02	759.759	2.739	I think that one goes there. So where's the other part of the butterfly?		
15	48	760.419	761.871	1.452	You can build on the butterfly		
15	48	766.392	767.58	1.188	You have to do it straight		
15	48	768.801	771.705	2.904	Straight, straight, see how you have to, you turn it around		
15	48	772.431	774.312	1.881	See the green? and green		
15	48	775.434	777.315	1.881	Think if you turn it around it will fit		
15	48	778.305	780.186	1.881	Yep, there you go		
15	48	782.628	784.674	2.046	Do you need help to get back up again? Here		
15	48	787.116	788.568	1.452		Aw you hurted me	
15	48	788.535	789.228	0.693	Sorry		
15	48	792.429	796.653	4.224		I think this is ### piece. Nope	
15	48	796.455	798.534	2.079	Mmm no, how 'bout you try on this side?		
15	48	798.171	804.309	6.138		*noises*	
15	48	805.266	807.741	2.475	Straight, straight. I think if you turn it around...		
15	48	808.533	809.127	0.594	No		
15	48	810.051	811.602	1.551	I think it you turn it around this way		
15	48	814.044	814.869	0.825	That's right		
15	48	815.793	816.915	1.122	See? That works		
15	48	817.839	821.733	3.894	And do we have another piece? NAME do we have another piece that looks like a butterfly piece?		
15	48	818.169	819.192	1.023		I pushed it	
15	48	821.766	822.162	0.396		Yeah	
15	48	822.195	824.835	2.64	'Kay which piece do we have that looks like a butterfly piece?		
15	48	825.132	828.201	3.069	'Member, it either goes here or here, 'cause we're building the border first		
15	48	831.138	833.415	2.277		*noises*	
15	48	833.415	836.88	3.465	There we go, how about this piece? Where do we think this piece goes, NAME?		
15	48	837.672	839.52	1.848		###	
15	48	849.222	850.278	1.056	Are you sure?

15	48	854.139	864.93	10.791	How 'bout we build, where's another corner piece so that it can help you? Ooh no, this is a corner piece, where do you think that corner piece goes? It's either gonna go in this corner or that corner, 'cause it's a corner piece		
15	48	854.997	855.591	0.594		*noises*	
15	48	857.439	858.198	0.759		*noises*	
15	48	861.465	862.257	0.792		###	
15	48	866.184	867.636	1.452		It goes right h- right-	
15	48	867.9	868.131	0.231			
15	48	869.055	871.893	2.838	No it's a corner piece, it goes in the corner, NAME		
15	48	872.685	875.325	2.64		Maybe try like this	
15	48	875.622	878.13	2.508	Lookit I think this one goes here, Lookit, NAME		
15	48	879.549	887.205	7.656	And I think this one goes, lookit, because it's got, lookit, one straight side, two straight sides. Let's try this one. See how it fits right in there?		
15	48	888.03	889.35	1.32	Oop- Okay		
15	48	890.142	892.98	2.838	Let's put all the other straight pieces all across the border		
15	48	894.399	896.115	1.716	Okay so where do you think this one goes?		
15	48	899.778	900.372	0.594		Nope	
15	48	900.702	901.23	0.528	No?		
15	48	904.332	905.421	1.089		### like	
15	48	911.163	916.608	5.445	I don't think so, 'cause lookit, that one has orange in it, and that doesn't have orange. It has green and red in it		
15	48	919.314	924.726	5.412		This is not green. This- this is not red this- this is pink	
15	48	927.069	928.026	0.957	How about...		
15	48	929.742	930.996	1.254	You try this piece in there		
15	48	935.352	936.969	1.617	### put back in the corn, hon		
15	48	939.081	941.721	2.64		This piece is super easy

15	48	941.259	942.282	1.023	You think so?		
15	48	943.668	947.958	4.29	I don't know if it's super easy, but how 'bout you try this piece, NAME. Look at this one		
15	48	949.608	952.413	2.805	Okay, that's right, and then...		
15	48	954.591	963.039	8.448	This one here has pink flower in it, look at this one. Can I show you something? This has pink in it, I think this has pink in it, so I think if you put it beside it might work		
15	48	963.963	966.504	2.541	Yeah, it does work, okay, so		
15	48	967.923	968.253	0.33		No	
15	48	968.352	970.167	1.815	Nope, let's see, NAME?		
15	48	970.068	970.497	0.429		What	
15	48	971.619	977.526	5.907	Let's see if this, umm, Do you think this piece works? Over here if you try it?		
15	48	978.912	980.694	1.782	I would- I think it fits up here		
15	48	980.991	982.443	1.452	I think this piece fits right here		
15	48	982.872	984.093	1.221	If you can try and see		
15	48	985.182	986.601	1.419	It does fit, NAME		
15	48	987.69	991.617	3.927	It does fit, okay so let's see what other flowers we have. Let me see?		
15	48	992.442	995.775	3.333	They're a little red flower there. Maybe this is it, right here		
15	48	997.194	998.943	1.749	Can you try it and see if it works for mom?		
15	48	1001.55	1004.85	3.3	Ooh you did it! You're doing such a good job. Ooh okay how 'bout this one?

15	48	1020.459	1021.746	1.287	You think this piece goes there?		
15	48	1022.835	1026.894	4.059	'Cause it got orange? But that doesn't have a straight piece so I think that goes over there		
15	48	1029.369	1031.382	2.013	There we go, there we go NAME		
15	48	1030.656	1032.801	2.145		And then we're connecting its	
15	48	1032.603	1036.464	3.861	We are connecting them, but we have to find some more straight pieces, right?		
15	48	1036.86	1041.348	4.488	Okay, so NAME, so what piece do you think goes right... here?		
15	48	1041.711	1043.46	1.749	What piece- Where does that piece go, you think		
15	48	1044.12	1045.572	1.452		I...	
15	48	1045.077	1046.067	0.99	That's a straight piece, though		
15	48	1048.179	1049.961	1.782		*noises*	
15	48	1048.608	1051.116	2.508	Ooh NAME, you wanna try this piece in there?		
15	48	1055.439	1056.627	1.188	I think it goes over here		
15	48	1059.597	1060.455	0.858		Like this?	
15	48	1060.686	1061.874	1.188	No... I guess not		
15	48	1062.072	1062.765	0.693		Like this?	
15	48	1062.864	1063.59	0.726	Nope		
15	48	1065.636	1069.431	3.795	I don't think it goes with that yet, 'cause we have to find something that has a pink flower in it		
15	48	1071.84	1081.047	9.207		*noises*	
15	48	1082.664	1083.984	1.32	'Kay, and what goes that one?		
15	48	1084.908	1089.462	4.554	These are all the straight pieces, so you work on straight pieces, I think we're missing some straight pieces		
15	48	1091.013	1092.432	1.419		Missing some	
15	48	1093.422	1094.445	1.023	There's a straight piece		
15	48	1093.455	1095.402	1.947		The pink piece	
15	48	1095.303	1096.326	1.023	That's a straight piece		
15	48	1098.438	1099.56	1.122	'Kay I think that's really it		
15	48	1099.758	1100.715	0.957	So let's try		
15	48	1101.804	1102.86	1.056	So what goes right here?		
15	48	1105.203	1106.292	1.089		I think it's	
15	48	1106.457	1107.678	1.221	You didn't drop any, did you?		
15	48	1107.876	1108.107	0.231			
15	48	1108.569	1109.526	0.957	I don't think so		
15	48	1109.922	1110.912	0.99	I didn't see you drop any		
15	48	1118.634	1121.043	2.409		I think we throwed them in the garbage	
15	48	1120.746	1122.33	1.584	Oh NAME I think I found a piece		
15	48	1123.287	1125.96	2.673	I think if you put that one there, I think this one fits right there

15	48	1132.725	1135.86	3.135	So, NAME, Where do you think this piece goes?		
15	48	1134.375	1134.804	0.429		What?	
15	48	1137.345	1139.457	2.112		Goes nowhere, except here	
15	48	1139.028	1143.021	3.993	I don't think so, that doesn't have orange or green in that color		
15	48	1144.209	1146.255	2.046	We can't push it 'cause it doesn't fit in there		
15	48	1147.179	1148.532	1.353	Maybe this one fits in there?		
15	48	1150.446	1151.337	0.891		That fits	
15	48	1151.832	1152.855	1.023	No, this one-

15	48	1169.652	1171.104	1.452	I think these ones go up here		
15	48	1178.133	1181.202	3.069	How bout this part over here, can I try something? Let me see		
15	48	1181.796	1186.581	4.785	Does that work in there? No, that doesn't work in there. That's not right. Here let me get it		
15	48	1186.284	1187.901	1.617		You're making it break	
15	48	1188.528	1189.254	0.726	Okay		
15	48	1189.287	1191.234	1.947		You're making it get breaked	
15	48	1191.168	1192.62	1.452	gonna make it break?		
15	48	1198.23	1199.22	0.99	###		
15	48	1203.576	1205.622	2.046		I think I got the right piece	
15	48	1221.594	1222.551	0.957		Think this one	
15	48	1228.029	1230.834	2.805	Lookit, NAME, I think I found it. Right there

15	48	1233.771	1240.833	7.062	And, we have one more piece, right here. It's kind of a small piece, let's see if we could find it. You wanna try this piece in there?		
15	48	1241.889	1243.011	1.122	No that doesn't work		
15	48	1245.519	1246.707	1.188	That doesn't work, oh-		
15	48	1247.499	1252.284	4.785	It has to be a piece, look at, that has two holes in it. Does this have two holes in it?		
15	48	1253.637	1254.792	1.155	Yeah but that's too big		
15	48	1255.947	1257.135	1.188	Does this have two holes in it?		
15	48	1262.811	1263.933	1.122	How 'bout you try this one		
15	48	1266.243	1267.101	0.858	Does that work?		
15	48	1267.992	1271.457	3.465		Nope. Too, m- medium

15	48	1271.787	1272.843	1.056		Too medium	
15	48	1274.559	1275.054	0.495		too	
15	48	1274.625	1275.747	1.122	It's too medium?		
15	48	1278.09	1279.542	1.452	And that's- Doesn't fit		
15	48	1281.258	1281.819	0.561	Hmm		
15	48	1282.677	1285.845	3.168		I wonder what piece that fits	
15	48	1286.967	1288.782	1.815		What piece fits	
15	48	1289.508	1291.026	1.518	I was wondering if we did a piece wrong		
15	48	1299.309	1301.19	1.881	Are you okay? Are you tired?		
15	48	1300.893	1301.685	0.792		Yes

15	48	1308.78	1310.562	1.782	We still have to do all these other pieces		
15	48	1311.453	1313.07	1.617	Look at all these pieces here		
15	48	1319.604	1322.574	2.97	Lookit, we'll put the tiger together, or leopard, I should say		
15	48	1323.828	1326.138	2.31	'cause he's got spots, so, uh, he goes together		
15	48	1329.504	1336.17	6.666		I never thought ###, I never ###	
15	48	1337.094	1340.262	3.168		Maybe this right piece	
15	48	1341.087	1343.958	2.871	Ooh NAME I think- I think this actually goes in there maybe		
15	48	1344.222	1345.113	0.891	Did you try that one?		
15	48	1347.456	1350.063	2.607		It's super... big	
15	48	1347.885	1348.149	0.264

15	48	1352.571	1355.805	3.234		Not fitting, making the puzzle break	
15	48	1353.957	1354.584	0.627	Hmm		
15	48	1356.696	1358.577	1.881	Well, yeah #		
15	48	1366.662	1369.401	2.739	And then maybe this one just goes to here, Here put that down		
15	48	1370.325	1371.051	0.726	Put it down, NAME		
15	48	1371.051	1372.008	0.957		I can't

16	48	132.792	134.277	1.485	Okay so let's put him in place		
16	48	134.277	137.412	3.135		And he's, he's  only a head	
16	48	136.422	142.461	6.039	So he has spots, right? I see some more pieces with spots. Does that look like part of a nose?

16	48	186.384	190.212	3.828	Probably his eyes go above his nose somehow, don't you think?		
16	48	191.004	191.532	0.528		Yes	
16	48	191.73	192.918	1.188	Yeah, probably

16	48	227.139	229.449	2.31	Hmm, I think it would need one of those...		
16	48	231.693	232.881	1.188	poker-outer pieces		
16	48	246.279	247.962	1.683	A-ha!		
16	48	251.988	255.882	3.894	Does that look like it's the jaguar's ear?		
16	48	258.258	259.842	1.584		It does look like	
16	48	260.37	262.185	1.815	I think that might be his ear		
16	48	262.878	264.363	1.485	And that might be the other one		
16	48	269.049	270.336	1.287		I don't know	
16	48	272.316	275.352	3.036	Hmm, maybe it goes a different way		
16	48	272.349	274.197	1.848		*noises*	
16	48	275.22	277.068	1.848		It's so hard!	
16	48	277.068	278.289	1.221	Maybe it goes this way		
16	48	280.533	281.325	0.792	No		
16	48	283.239	286.44	3.201	Maybe it goes like this, there's a little white there, maybe it goes like that?		
16	48	288.024	289.113	1.089		No	
16	48	288.783	289.476	0.693	No		
16	48	291.39	292.974	1.584	Does the ear go like this?		
16	48	294.921	299.112	4.191	Hmm, no. I think we have to match up the spots		
16	48	300.399	301.95	1.551	Can you help me match up the spots?		
16	48	303.138	304.095	0.957		Mm-hmm	
16	48	304.425	307.329	2.904	See, if he has an ear here and an ear there...		
16	48	314.127	320.232	6.105	Mm-hmm! Now we're just missing his other ear. Oop! I see a little piece with spots on it		
16	48	322.872	324.39	1.518		With spots on it	
16	48	325.248	327.129	1.881		Now what- Ooh!	
16	48	326.205	329.571	3.366	Hmm, and then what's gonna go down here?		
16	48	331.221	335.775	4.554	So let's keep that one over here since this one also has spots on it and maybe we'll figure out-		
16	48	331.353	332.079	0.726		Uh	
16	48	332.904	333.135	0.231			
16	48	337.392	338.745	1.353	A butterfly		
16	48	339.834	342.441	2.607		I can't do this butterfly, this butterfly is-	
16	48	347.721	350.889	3.168	I think we're gonna run out of room, maybe if we move him over a little bit		
16	48	351.12	361.284	10.164	We've got a bunch of butterfly pieces here. Ooh! This one's a straight edge, so that- It e- It either goes here, or here, don't you think? Do you think it goes down here, or over here?		
16	48	361.878	367.653	5.775		I think this might go over here, this has spots	
16	48	367.752	368.478	0.726	Mm-hmm		
16	48	369.732	370.491	0.759		###	
16	48	370.161	373.56	3.399	Does it fit there? Well this has a blade of green grass coming down		
16	48	379.203	380.754	1.551	There we go		
16	48	386.694	390.819	4.125		Looks a little bit like a monarch butter- butterfly	
16	48	390.06	396.462	6.402	Hmm, like a monarch butterfly? I thought monarchs were orange and black		
16	48	397.32	399.069	1.749		Yes they are but these-	
16	48	398.64	403.953	5.313	But we've seen butterflies that are- have that blue color at the butterfly museum, haven't we?		
16	48	404.448	405.966	1.518		Yeah, I have	
16	48	408.54	410.454	1.914	I see little spots in there		
16	48	412.335	413.49	1.155		Let's go right here	
16	48	413.457	416.097	2.64	Mm-hmm, we've almost got the butterfly all put together		
16	48	416.757	420.189	3.432	So #### got another piece here, and another piece here		
16	48	423.258	426.888	3.63	Ooh, and this piece. That looks like a corner		
16	48	430.584	431.244	0.66		Aah!	
16	48	431.409	431.937	0.528	Hmm?		
16	48	431.871	435.963	4.092		This goes- This goes more down over here	
16	48	434.94	436.557	1.617	You sure that this one fits here?		
16	48	437.019	440.88	3.861	It doesn't seem to fit very well. I think this one must not go here		
16	48	443.454	447.216	3.762		Yes it does, see?	
16	48	446.193	448.602	2.409	But look at the little lines, they don't match up		
16	48	450.054	455.796	5.742	I don't know. We've got one other piece, why don't you try one- the other piece and see if it fits better than that one does		
16	48	459.657	462.924	3.267	That's a corner, we can zip it down		
16	48	461.901	464.112	2.211			
16	48	467.61	468.897	1.287			
16	48	469.788	470.547	0.759	There!		
16	48	473.022	473.781	0.759		*laughing*	
16	48	473.649	476.388	2.739	This one still has the spots where do you think that one goes?		
16	48	479.787	480.117	0.33		Oh	
16	48	479.787	482.889	3.102	Ooh, I think this is an ear here		
16	48	483.945	485.298	1.353			
16	48	485.067	485.793	0.726	Yeah		
16	48	487.74	491.601	3.861		Was he a ear here	
16	48	490.413	491.205	0.792	Oh!		
16	48	492.162	494.439	2.277	Now he has his two ears and he can hear us		
16	48	495.429	498.465	3.036	Hello, Mr. Jaguar, how are you?		
16	48	505.527	507.276	1.749		Ow I ####	
16	48	506.286	506.979	0.693	Hmm		
16	48	507.771	508.86	1.089			
16	48	508.926	509.322	0.396	There		
16	48	511.533	517.638	6.105	Alright, what's next? Should we do the snake? Or there's some sort of a plant over here?		
16	48	514.965	515.889	0.924		*noises*	
16	48	519.651	522.357	2.706		There's, a frog is on	
16	48	523.05	523.677	0.627	Huh		
16	48	525.525	527.34	1.815		Those go over there	
16	48	527.34	529.452	2.112	Well here's another part of that plant		
16	48	530.541	533.115	2.574	And here's another part, now this has an edge		
16	48	534.039	536.91	2.871		Here's some more of, some more	
16	48	538.989	539.814	0.825		####	
16	48	539.418	547.767	8.349	Ooh I see some froggy toes like that over here with this piece. Maybe these are not too far away from each other. They also have similar stripes		
16	48	551.166	551.727	0.561	Mmm		
16	48	553.278	557.403	4.125	Since they- They aren't attached to anything yet they might be difficult to figure out		
16	48	559.779	564.102	4.323	But we know that those are froggy feet, right? So here's the frog		
16	48	566.874	569.844	2.97		This is the big frog and this is the little frog	
16	48	570.207	571.263	1.056	Mm-hmm		
16	48	572.154	574.629	2.475		Mommy, I see a little f-

16	48	573.045	576.246	3.201	### Oh there's more frog feet, how many frogs were there?		
16	48	577.005	577.698	0.693		Two	
16	48	580.272	585.882	5.61	Maybe those are the toes that are missing, Mm-hmm		
16	48	587.169	588.984	1.815	We've reattached its toes		
16	48	590.766	593.208	2.442		His toes ####	
16	48	596.904	600.831	3.927		####	
16	48	598.62	601.689	3.069	There you go! Do a little surgery and get his toes back on		
16	48	602.679	604.395	1.716	There! Great		
16	48	606.045	607.464	1.419	Hmm		
16	48	610.566	613.734	3.168	Okay, so we've got froggy feet, we have a frog head-		
16	48	618.915	621.192	2.277	No, that doesn't go there		
16	48	623.04	626.208	3.168	Maybe these are in the way, put these over here, yeah?		
16	48	626.703	628.815	2.112		I think this goes right here	
16	48	627.825	628.782	0.957			
16	48	629.409	630.267	0.858	Good eyes

16	48	632.511	635.019	2.508	This looks like this attaches right there		
16	48	632.808	634.821	2.013			
16	48	638.451	639.441	0.99		It does

16	48	690.855	693.594	2.739		Yeah it is this ####	
16	48	691.944	693.627	1.683	And then this would be another part		
16	48	694.716	696.201	1.485			
16	48	696.432	698.148	1.716			
16	48	697.686	699.303	1.617		*noises*	
16	48	699.138	702.471	3.333	Ooh he's missing his eye, his other eye		
16	48	703.494	704.913	1.419	Can you see it anywhere?		
16	48	705.771	710.292	4.521	I think this is probably the sloth's hand, so that goes with the s- Oh and here's the other-		
16	48	711.843	713.559	1.716	I'd say those go together		
16	48	715.935	717.42	1.485	Where's the snake's eye?		
16	48	724.713	725.373	0.66	Hmm!		
16	48	728.937	730.257	1.32	Oh well, we'll find it

16	48	735.57	736.89	1.32	Well now I don't remember		
16	48	737.946	742.368	4.422	Perhaps something else is covering it up. We'll find out when we get to that piece		
16	48	746.295	749.463	3.168	Here's another corner. I bet this one goes down here		
16	48	750.156	750.915	0.759		Mommy	
16	48	751.212	754.677	3.465	So then we just have one more corner to find

16	48	798.072	800.877	2.805			
16	48	798.138	800.052	1.914		What are leaf-cutter ants?	
16	48	799.821	811.305	11.484	Well they cut the leaves, with their jaws, and they carry the leaves down into their, nest underground, and they grow a fungus on the leaves, and then they eat the fungus		
16	48	807.444	809.391	1.947

16	48	826.353	827.871	1.518			
16	48	834.636	836.748	2.112	This one doesn't look like an edge piece		
16	48	838.728	840.378	1.65	But this one looks like an edge piece		
16	48	841.929	844.206	2.277		This go right here, it goes right here

16	24	1313.499	1314.753	1.254	*laughing* that would hurt		
16	24	1315.578	1320.33	4.752	It might hurt enough to make the shark swim away, don't you think? Would you like to do the shark next?

20	48	115.599	120.714	5.115	And I'll keep looking for edge pieces. You can start putting them together if you see some that-

20	48	128.931	131.901	2.97	Fit 'em together. Any more edges? Sorry		
20	48	135.366	137.115	1.749		Is that where it goes?	
20	48	137.214	140.547	3.333	Mmm, does that really fit? Does that- Not quite

20	48	148.5	150.117	1.617		Let's check on the board	
20	48	150.117	156.288	6.171	Mmm, well let's take a guess. If the frog is sitting up, would it fit down here? Like this?		
20	48	156.684	158.961	2.277		It's sitting on the rose!	
20	48	159.885	160.446	0.561		###

20	48	171.6	175.032	3.432	So it has to fit into one of these corners, this corner's full		
20	48	176.649	177.507	0.858	Does that look right?		
20	48	177.606	178.497	0.891		No	
20	48	178.332	179.157	0.825	What about over here?

20	48	298.386	300.234	1.848		Do you think that looks right?	
20	48	299.904	300.102	0.198			
20	48	300.135	301.785	1.65	I think that looks just right		
20	48	303.237	304.59	1.353	You got some more um-		
20	48	306.306	307.461	1.155	Where does this go?		
20	48	306.405	308.286	1.881		Butterfly pieces	
20	48	307.758	308.319	0.561	Does that-		
20	48	309.078	310.959	1.881		Yes! It looks right	
20	48	311.454	316.734	5.28	Does it? It does look right, but, the mushrooms- Let's take a look at our- at our picture		
20	48	312.048	313.401	1.353		No	
20	48	320.397	322.41	2.013	The mushrooms have to be on the bottom		
20	48	323.565	324.786	1.221		Probably yeah	
20	48	324.258	324.951	0.693	So		
20	48	326.238	327.228	0.99	Maybe		
20	48	330.363	332.739	2.376	Unless we're looking at that picture sideways		
20	48	336.435	337.392	0.957	Butterfly		
20	48	343.068	345.312	2.244	Oh boy, NAME. Silly Mom		
20	48	344.157	344.817	0.66		###	
20	48	346.269	346.632	0.363		What?	
20	48	346.797	348.315	1.518	This actually goes over here		
20	48	348.513	349.8	1.287		What silly mom	
20	48	349.701	351.681	1.98			
20	48	349.734	352.704	2.97	I was looking at it sideways and my brain didn't flip it over		
20	48	354.288	355.344	1.056		What brain?	
20	48	355.74	356.895	1.155			
20	48	357.654	359.073	1.419	My brain inside my head		
20	48	359.436	360.558	1.122			
20	48	359.634	360.888	1.254	That looks better		
20	48	361.152	361.812	0.66		Yeah	
20	48	361.68	362.967	1.287	That makes more sense		
20	48	364.221	368.148	3.927		I think this one goes right... here	
20	48	366.828	368.115	1.287			
20	48	370.722	374.517	3.795	I think I see some butterfly in that- on that kitty's nose		
20	48	375.54	376.431	0.891	So maybe		
20	48	376.233	377.388	1.155			
20	48	379.038	381.744	2.706	Maybe that goes, you know, closer to the butterfly		
20	48	385.407	386.562	1.155			
20	48	389.73	391.314	1.584		Do you think that looks right?	
20	48	391.743	392.799	1.056			
20	48	393.987	394.482	0.495	What?		
20	48	394.878	395.439	0.561	Show me		
20	48	395.538	398.046	2.508		Do you think this... looks right?	
20	48	398.409	402.501	4.092	No, not quite, maybe this- Does that look like a butterfly's body?		
20	48	403.425	404.58	1.155		Yes	
20	48	404.712	407.022	2.31	Okay try to fit it in where you think it should go		
20	48	410.388	411.345	0.957			
20	48	412.269	413.193	0.924			
20	48	416.658	417.648	0.99			
20	48	418.407	419.562	1.155			
20	48	420.189	422.202	2.013		Hey! It fit	
20	48	420.816	423.951	3.135	Hey, nice. And I can see some of the spots on that-		
20	48	424.578	426.459	1.881	Is this a leopard or a jaguar?		
20	48	426.789	430.221	3.432		Jaguar. Because it has spots	
20	48	431.574	432.927	1.353	Cool. So...		
20	48	432.399	433.752	1.353			
20	48	436.656	437.811	1.155	What about, um		
20	48	439.329	440.715	1.386			
20	48	441.87	444.345	2.475	What about the, any m- Are there any other c-		
20	48	443.025	445.665	2.64		Hey, we're doing great!	
20	48	445.104	449.427	4.323	We're doing great, yeah. Are there any more butterfly pieces that you can find?		
20	48	448.206	449.394	1.188			
20	48	450.549	450.945	0.396		Um	
20	48	450.912	452.199	1.287			
20	48	451.11	454.443	3.333	Look for that bright blue. I think it's the only thing with that nice		
20	48	453.915	454.608	0.693		This	
20	48	455.037	457.974	2.937	And here's an extra piece that was flipped over on it's face		
20	48	458.403	460.977	2.574	That looks like it might have part of the kitty nose on it		
20	48	462.033	463.122	1.089			
20	48	464.145	465.762	1.617		It works!

20	48	568.326	569.382	1.056			
20	48	570.108	572.451	2.343	Maybe this little cheek is missing a spot

20	48	726.0	727.254	1.254	Maybe if you rotate it		
20	48	728.673	729.96	1.287		Mmm this one

20	48	766.722	767.283	0.561		Yeah	
20	48	766.953	768.57	1.617	Maybe you'll have to rotate that one too

20	48	771.639	772.299	0.66	Yeah

20	24	884.862	888.492	3.63	Remember, a corner has two straight sides- Ah! Careful		
20	24	890.703	891.693	0.99	Uh		
20	24	892.617	893.904	1.287		Where is *name*?	
20	24	893.772	895.158	1.386	She's doing some games		
20	24	895.719	899.151	3.432		Where's the games at? Where's the games?	
20	24	900.768	905.982	5.214	I don't know. In one of these rooms nearby. Okay, now you find the corners this time		
20	24	901.89	902.121	0.231			
20	24	906.873	907.401	0.528	One		
20	24	910.734	911.922	1.188		Does that look right?	
20	24	911.988	915.552	3.564	Mmm, Maybe but, you did find a corner that's all I asked		
20	24	916.047	917.169	1.122	Three corners left		
20	24	918.918	921.822	2.904	A corner has two straight sides		
20	24	922.515	923.934	1.419	Does that have two straight sides?		
20	24	924.594	925.452	0.858		No	
20	24	925.716	926.871	1.155	That's only got one		
20	24	927.927	929.412	1.485	But that is an edge piece		
20	24	930.468	932.448	1.98	I think I remember this big eye		
20	24	932.877	933.405	0.528		###	
20	24	933.636	934.725	1.089	Is that the whale's eye?		
20	24	935.022	935.748	0.726		Yeah	
20	24	936.342	937.761	1.419	So that goes over here, right?		
20	24	938.322	938.916	0.594	Like that?		
20	24	939.048	940.401	1.353			
20	24	940.203	943.338	3.135	But we still need three corners, do you see any?		
20	24	944.13	945.252	1.122	I think I found one		
20	24	946.77	948.255	1.485	You wanna just do the edges first?		
20	24	947.199	948.519	1.32			
20	24	949.443	950.334	0.891		No, look	
20	24	950.499	951.324	0.825	You're doing it		
20	24	951.654	952.578	0.924		I did it	
20	24	953.601	957.033	3.432	Okay, we'll do- We'll just do the edges and the corners. You find 'em		
20	24	958.419	960.498	2.079	Any pieces with straight side- Mmhmm		
20	24	963.732	964.524	0.792	Any others?		
20	24	965.052	966.141	1.089	Should be some more, right?		
20	24	967.692	970.596	2.904	There's one. Hey, that looks a little bit like this piece		
20	24	973.698	975.876	2.178	Oh yeah, Does that look like-		
20	24	976.206	977.262	1.056		Yeah!	
20	24	977.163	979.374	2.211	Does that look like the top of the water? Like the-		
20	24	980.133	980.892	0.759		Yeah!	
20	24	980.628	984.192	3.564	And the sky above? So this must go somewhere towards the top, right?		
20	24	984.192	985.347	1.155		Yeah, there!	
20	24	985.743	989.703	3.96	But, it's a corner so... slide it over		
20	24	991.848	993.333	1.485			
20	24	992.838	993.333	0.495	Okay		
20	24	994.488	995.115	0.627	Now what?		
20	24	997.788	999.735	1.947		Hey that's a jellyfish	
20	24	998.382	999.009	0.627	###		
20	24	999.438	1000.56	1.122	It is a jellyfish		
20	24	1001.055	1005.312	4.257	Do you see any more... edge pieces or corners?		
20	24	1006.731	1007.226	0.495	Yes		
20	24	1008.513	1010.46	1.947	Hmm, that looks like a big smiling mouth		
20	24	1010.724	1011.186	0.462		*noises*	
20	24	1010.724	1012.044	1.32			
20	24	1011.483	1012.77	1.287	Yeah		
20	24	1013.793	1014.321	0.528	Good		
20	24	1015.773	1016.367	0.594	What else?		
20	24	1018.215	1020.459	2.244		Nah- *gasp* Ooh	
20	24	1020.921	1023.0	2.079	Yeah, you got another corner		
20	24	1021.878	1022.142	0.264			
20	24	1021.944	1023.759	1.815		It's part of the shark	
20	24	1024.089	1033.263	9.174	Where does it go? I think I see that line again, the- the line where the water and the sky meet, but, it's a corner piece, right? So it goes in the-		
20	24	1035.573	1036.365	0.792		Uh	
20	24	1036.827	1041.447	4.62	Corner pieces # go in the... corners, right?		
20	24	1041.282	1042.074	0.792		Mm-hmm	
20	24	1042.932	1043.658	0.726	Yeah		
20	24	1044.978	1045.605	0.627	Okay		
20	24	1047.387	1048.905	1.518	See any more edge pieces?		
20	24	1051.281	1052.304	1.023	I see some		
20	24	1052.832	1054.581	1.749		I see one	
20	24	1054.581	1056.726	2.145	Yeah, that's a corner too		
20	24	1057.749	1061.346	3.597	Nice, so you have all four corners. Now we need some more edges		
20	24	1058.079	1059.168	1.089			
20	24	1063.821	1066.428	2.607	What's up here? That light blue sky, right?		
20	24	1065.273	1066.989	1.716		Mom mom mom!	
20	24	1066.659	1067.649	0.99	You found one!		
20	24	1068.771	1070.685	1.914	Yeah, that goes somewhere at the top		
20	24	1071.609	1074.612	3.003	Now it looks like you have one, two more top edge pieces		
20	24	1075.437	1078.572	3.135	They probably also have that like, light blue sky on them		
20	24	1077.714	1078.176	0.462		Mom!	
20	24	1079.199	1081.08	1.881		I think it goes right here	
20	24	1081.179	1082.07	0.891	mmm		
20	24	1082.334	1083.258	0.924		Nah	
20	24	1083.456	1085.007	1.551	Nah, doesn't quite fit in		
20	24	1086.426	1089.594	3.168	Let's keep looking for those edge pieces, then we can put 'em together		
20	24	1091.046	1092.135	1.089	Do I hear *name*?		
20	24	1092.927	1094.412	1.485		Let me go check	
20	24	1093.191	1097.613	4.422	if she's all done- Let's not check, let's finish ours and then we can go check		
20	24	1098.933	1101.342	2.409	Here, can I scoot you in? Oops, sorry		
20	24	1099.923	1101.045	1.122		###

20	24	1108.305	1109.064	0.759	Yeah		
20	24	1109.658	1110.681	1.023			
20	24	1111.968	1113.222	1.254	Any more edge pieces?		
20	24	1112.232	1113.42	1.188			
20	24	1116.06	1117.974	1.914	I think I found one, Oops		
20	24	1120.779	1121.703	0.924		I found one	
20	24	1121.802	1122.495	0.693	Good!		
20	24	1124.64	1126.323	1.683	See any of that orange anywhere?		
20	24	1127.181	1128.534	1.353	On any of the other edges?		
20	24	1130.019	1130.58	0.561		No	
20	24	1131.339	1132.824	1.485	What about any of the corners?		
20	24	1137.081	1138.005	0.924		Yeah	
20	24	1139.985	1141.173	1.188			
20	24	1141.767	1142.493	0.726	Good!		
20	24	1141.932	1142.064	0.132			
20	24	1142.79	1144.176	1.386		Does that look right?	
20	24	1144.176	1145.001	0.825	Yeah it does		
20	24	1145.76	1147.476	1.716	Okay we need a few more edges		
20	24	1148.895	1150.083	1.188	Yeah		
20	24	1151.898	1153.152	1.254	It looks like we need one-		
20	24	1153.845	1156.683	2.838	two, three, four, five more edge pieces		
20	24	1158.795	1160.313	1.518	So let's look for some clues		
20	24	1160.775	1162.194	1.419	We got this red crab		
20	24	1162.689	1164.867	2.178	We got the orange octopus		
20	24	1165.692	1167.342	1.65	But that's not an edge piece, right?		
20	24	1169.355	1171.434	2.079	Looks like it goes somewhere nearby, though		
20	24	1172.193	1173.744	1.551	Doesn't have a straight edge on it		
20	24	1176.714	1177.341	0.627	Right?		
20	24	1177.968	1179.387	1.419		It doesn't go there	
20	24	1179.519	1181.862	2.343	We need some straight edged pieces		
20	24	1183.776	1184.898	1.122	mmm		
20	24	1186.68	1188.033	1.353	Maybe this slides over here		
20	24	1187.175	1188.66	1.485			
20	24	1193.115	1193.841	0.726	Yeah		
20	24	1193.676	1194.798	1.122			
20	24	1195.425	1197.537	2.112	And then you've got purple next		
20	24	1198.329	1200.111	1.782	See any- Yeah		
20	24	1199.847	1202.421	2.574		That's purple octopus	
20	24	1201.134	1202.322	1.188	Where's that straight edge?		
20	24	1204.137	1205.259	1.122	NAME look at your piece		
20	24	1206.843	1207.932	1.089	Look at your puzzle piece		
20	24	1208.493	1209.681	1.188	Where's the straight edge go?		
20	24	1212.189	1212.783	0.594	Mm-hmm		
20	24	1213.839	1215.192	1.353			
20	24	1215.588	1219.119	3.531	Good! Okay, now we've got the orange octopus and the gray shark		
20	24	1218.294	1219.515	1.221			
20	24	1221.132	1221.825	0.693	Yeah		
20	24	1222.947	1224.168	1.221			
20	24	1225.059	1226.445	1.386	And some more gray shark		
20	24	1232.253	1233.309	1.056			
20	24	1234.299	1234.992	0.693	Yeah		
20	24	1241.889	1243.638	1.749		Does it go right here?	
20	24	1242.879	1244.067	1.188			
20	24	1244.166	1244.76	0.594	Yes		
20	24	1248.555	1249.611	1.056	Any more edges?		
20	24	1250.469	1252.482	2.013	I think we're missing two edge pieces		
20	24	1253.439	1255.155	1.716	You wanna do that c- crab?		
20	24	1255.452	1256.145	0.693		Mm-hmm	
20	24	1257.828	1258.455	0.627	Rotate		
20	24	1260.039	1261.161	1.122			
20	24	1260.336	1260.93	0.594	mm-hmm		
20	24	1264.758	1265.286	0.528	Now what?		
20	24	1269.18	1271.655	2.475		I think we should rotate it	
20	24	1273.14	1273.965	0.825		Nah	
20	24	1273.272	1274.097	0.825	Hmm		
20	24	1274.691	1275.912	1.221	I see this blue color

20	24	1280.895	1282.182	1.287			
20	24	1284.591	1285.086	0.495	Good

20	24	1288.881	1290.564	1.683	Is that a baby or a toy?		
20	24	1298.253	1299.507	1.254	You can move ##		
20	24	1302.774	1304.754	1.98	Sometimes you gotta wiggle it into place		
20	24	1306.272	1307.724	1.452			
20	24	1309.11	1311.189	2.079	Good. Three, four more pieces		
20	24	1312.278	1313.202	0.924	You're almost done		
20	24	1315.743	1317.228	1.485	Barnacles, right?		
20	24	1318.317	1319.076	0.759		Mm-hmm	
20	24	1320.033	1321.188	1.155			
20	24	1321.617	1323.927	2.31	And, can you find a-		
20	24	1325.577	1329.075	3.498	Who's fin is that? Is that the shark's fin or is that somebody else's fin?		
20	24	1330.065	1331.979	1.914		Somebody else's	
20	24	1332.672	1333.299	0.627	Whose is it?		
20	24	1335.015	1338.447	3.432	You've got a good clue on here. It's a- it's got a straight edge on it		
20	24	1340.262	1340.955	0.693	Yeah		
20	24	1340.394	1341.417	1.023

21	24	2.541	3.102	0.561		Mm-hmm	
21	24	3.234	4.191	0.957	Okay, should we dump it?		
21	24	4.95	5.544	0.594		Uh-huh	
21	24	5.544	7.161	1.617	That's kinda the fun part of puzzles, huh?

21	24	45.21	49.137	3.927	So let's see. Oh boy this is kind of a tough puzzle		
21	24	51.051	54.945	3.894	so let's see, maybe we can find some edges first		
21	24	56.562	59.466	2.904	Can you find some straight edges? Straight parts?		
21	24	59.895	60.093	0.198

21	24	84.48	87.45	2.97	Well no we- we can just move our chairs we can't move the table		
21	24	88.473	91.377	2.904	No no no no please don't move the table You wanna push back?		
21	24	90.651	91.872	1.221		# Yeah

21	24	98.868	101.244	2.376	*laughing* Well I see but it's not better for doing a puzzle		
21	24	102.069	102.861	0.792		Oh!	
21	24	102.762	104.841	2.079	Yeah, can you find the rest of the seahorse?		
21	24	104.643	108.537	3.894		Oh, yeah but I have to push, my scientist chair back in	
21	24	108.24	111.342	3.102	Yeah, you better scoot your scientist chair back in. Okay		
21	24	112.068	112.53	0.462		*noises*	
21	24	113.19	115.467	2.277		Put it- Scoo- scoot it back in

21	24	122.463	130.614	8.151	Okay, a whale scientist and a seahorse scientist. Okay so let's look for something that's yellow, and spiky, and a head of a seahorse *gasp*		
21	24	131.01	141.768	10.758	There you go! Alright. Now this, hmm, this kinda looks like a pink jellyfish. Can you find anything that looks like a pink jellyfish? Alright, that looks like part of it		
21	24	142.89	150.183	7.293	Hmm, Let's see, anything else? I think that's a good guess I think we should save that		
21	24	150.579	152.526	1.947	Here maybe is some more		
21	24	153.483	154.902	1.419	Let's find all the pink-		
21	24	156.057	157.872	1.815	Jellyfishy pieces		
21	24	160.875	164.439	3.564	Oh, hey great job!		
21	24	165.066	170.808	5.742	Very good! So now, this looks like it's a corner, here		
21	24	171.204	175.659	4.455	So, should we put it in the, in the tray?		
21	24	175.725	176.286	0.561		Mm-hmm	
21	24	176.319	180.18	3.861	So, where do you think this corner is gonna go? I'll help you lift it

21	24	185.229	192.456	7.227	Yeah, so we'll move it up here, oops, oh, oh boy! oh boy! We're losing our pieces!		
21	24	187.11	188.265	1.155			
21	24	188.793	189.684	0.891			
21	24	194.139	196.053	1.914	Okay, you-		
21	24	195.426	197.34	1.914		It's better if I do it like this, see?	
21	24	197.34	201.498	4.158	Okay, I see. You're doing a great job! So let's see		
21	24	203.082	204.072	0.99		I was right!	
21	24	203.214	203.709	0.495	*sigh*		
21	24	203.544	204.732	1.188			
21	24	204.039	205.326	1.287	You were right!		
21	24	205.986	207.108	1.122	Aah, ok-		
21	24	206.547	207.9	1.353		I wasn't wrong?	
21	24	207.801	212.256	4.455	You were not wrong. So let's see, can you find any more jellyfishy pieces?		
21	24	213.18	216.216	3.036	Some pink jellyfishy pieces, like maybe this one?		
21	24	220.077	221.133	1.056			
21	24	220.869	231.066	10.197	Oh yeah, and the seahorse's nose. Good job. Okay, now, let's see what else there is, there's something blue here, with a blue fin		
21	24	231.759	234.069	2.31	Can you find something that's that color blue?		
21	24	236.775	239.415	2.64	Mmkay, hmm		
21	24	240.471	244.2	3.729	And maybe it's one- Oh oh! Maybe, here try turning that		
21	24	244.926	246.444	1.518	'Cause see here's some pink		
21	24	246.609	247.731	1.122			
21	24	247.665	249.843	2.178	Yeah! Great job		
21	24	250.536	252.912	2.376	Okay so then there's more blue		
21	24	254.958	257.532	2.574	So let's find pieces that have blue		
21	24	257.994	261.327	3.333	And a straight edge, 'cause there'll be a straight edge up here		
21	24	262.185	264.363	2.178	So let's see can you find anything that has blue?		
21	24	265.023	271.26	6.237	I think I see one. And it has blue, and some water drops coming off that look like this		
21	24	272.217	274.494	2.277	Look for some water drops like this		
21	24	275.814	281.028	5.214	Mmm, not quite. L- That's a good guess though, that has some water drops		
21	24	283.239	285.714	2.475	*gasp* try that, okay		
21	24	289.377	290.532	1.155			
21	24	289.707	292.314	2.607	Great! Alright!		
21	24	292.05	294.03	1.98		No, we need it's head	
21	24	294.063	298.386	4.323	Yeah, now we need to find it's head. Maybe there's an eye on it or something		
21	24	299.508	300.795	1.287	Hmm		
21	24	299.904	300.168	0.264			
21	24	303.6	305.217	1.617	It's kind of a toughie		
21	24	307.758	308.847	1.089	mmm		
21	24	308.715	309.276	0.561		Blue!	
21	24	309.54	312.708	3.168	Yeah, you're right that's blue, it's a little bit different color blue		
21	24	313.698	318.252	4.554	Oh, you know what I think it is? I think it's a little bit tricky		
21	24	318.549	329.406	10.857	Because I think this is a swordfish. And so it has a long beak kind of a thing. Can you find something with a long beak on the table?		
21	24	332.706	333.168	0.462		Hmm	
21	24	333.663	334.191	0.528	Hmm		
21	24	333.861	335.511	1.65		This is a little bit tricky	
21	24	335.115	336.93	1.815	It is a tricky puzzle, it is		
21	24	336.996	337.623	0.627		Uh-huh	
21	24	337.656	338.184	0.528	Yeah

21	24	340.89	341.517	0.627		A-ha!	
21	24	342.54	343.893	1.353		I think I see one	
21	24	343.893	345.609	1.716	Look, look over on this side		
21	24	346.467	347.655	1.188	Look over here		
21	24	348.546	351.516	2.97	Look over here. Long yellow beak		
21	24	351.813	352.341	0.528		*gasp*	
21	24	353.034	356.862	3.828	Look for something long and yellow. Over here, Look over here		
21	24	359.139	359.898	0.759		Where?	
21	24	360.723	362.406	1.683	Do you see something long and yellow?		
21	24	363.231	366.267	3.036	There you go *gasp* Great job!		
21	24	363.693	364.551	0.858			
21	24	366.201	367.521	1.32		What's the fish saying?	
21	24	366.927	376.398	9.471	"He says ""Thanks for putting me together I need the very tippy end of my nose."" Can you find the very tippy end of this yellow piece? Another yellow piece like that?"		
21	24	377.883	381.447	3.564	*gasp* Wow great job		
21	24	379.005	379.995	0.99			
21	24	381.414	383.922	2.508		Hmm, seems like this black whale

21	24	400.587	402.336	1.749		Now there's one more piece	
21	24	403.095	409.86	6.765	Yeah, let's see, now okay, now that has a straight edge, so that's gonna go against, yeah yeah yeah! Great!		
21	24	407.781	408.804	1.023			
21	24	411.081	412.038	0.957	Alright		
21	24	412.797	414.645	1.848	So we need some more of this shark		
21	24	415.701	416.724	1.023	Alright		
21	24	417.615	418.539	0.924	Hmm		
21	24	420.288	436.095	15.807	I think, here well, if a piece goes there, it has to have some, here try that piece, where is another- where is another piece of the shark would- would need some, 'cause this- this looks like- Look, it looks like the shark's head with his teeth, so maybe put that towards the front of the shark		
21	24	439.131	441.21	2.079	Yeah yeah yeah, I think- ah no I think you were right		
21	24	443.487	444.477	0.99	Yeah yeah

21	24	452.133	455.697	3.564	"He says ""Thanks for putting me together I guess I won't eat you up now"""		
21	24	457.215	467.61	10.395	He does need a little bit of his tail, still. So there needs to be a piece with some gray on it. And some orange for the octopus. It'll have a gray nubby part.		
21	24	467.94	470.547	2.607		What's- What's he saying when he can't swim yet?	
21	24	470.448	473.649	3.201	"He says ""I can't swim yet 'cause my tail isn't all together yet"""		
21	24	475.926	476.586	0.66		Hmm	
21	24	476.586	477.444	0.858	Hmm		
21	24	477.378	480.117	2.739		"We say ""Don't worry Mr. Whale, we'll fix you"""	
21	24	480.282	484.011	3.729	Yep we will. Let's find another eye for the octopus too

21	24	490.677	492.888	2.211	Don't worry Mr. Whale we'll fix you		
21	24	493.053	494.274	1.221		What's the whale saying?	
21	24	493.779	496.155	2.376	"He says ""Oh I sure hope so"""		
21	24	497.244	501.402	4.158	I think the rest of my tail is on a piece with an eye for an octopus		
21	24	502.062	504.504	2.442	*gasp* Mmm		
21	24	502.491	505.923	3.432		Hmm

21	24	515.328	517.506	2.178	Okay now we need the rest of the octopus		
21	24	517.803	519.189	1.386		What's the- octopus saying?	
21	24	519.288	526.944	7.656	"He says ""Hey put me together. I need all my legs"""		
21	24	527.109	531.432	4.323		"Oh he's- he's supposed to say, ""I need all my legs"""	
21	24	531.036	535.557	4.521	I need all my legs. All eight of them		
21	24	534.864	538.329	3.465		"No! He's supposed to say ""I need my legs"""	
21	24	538.131	541.926	3.795	I need my legs. Please put my legs on me		
21	24	539.88	540.111	0.231

21	24	544.665	545.556	0.891	Great		
21	24	545.721	547.899	2.178		What's he saying when he can't swim yet?	
21	24	547.47	551.232	3.762	"He says ""I can't- I still can't swim yet! I need more legs!"""		
21	24	553.41	554.631	1.221			
21	24	554.73	555.951	1.221		Now what's he saying?	
21	24	555.918	558.69	2.772	"Now he says ""Oh! Almost all my legs!"""		
21	24	562.947	566.049	3.102	I think there's a starfish with its legs		
21	24	567.336	568.029	0.693		*gasp*	
21	24	568.92	570.438	1.518		What's the starfish saying?	
21	24	570.669	573.507	2.838	Oh, try it in the corner. See how it's a corner?		
21	24	578.028	579.018	0.99			
21	24	578.919	580.833	1.914	Great job. Okay		
21	24	579.843	581.394	1.551		What's- What's he say?	
21	24	581.823	588.984	7.161	"The starfish is saying ""Oh, thanks for putting me together!"" Now it looks like there's going to be something with some sand and some purple stuff"		
21	24	589.842	593.571	3.729	So look for some purple anemone things		
21	24	594.132	596.211	2.079	Oh yeah, there's a good one		
21	24	597.762	600.633	2.871		It's a purple, and a anemone thing?	
21	24	600.567	601.491	0.924	Anemone		
21	24	602.976	603.603	0.627		Why?	
21	24	603.999	606.738	2.739	Yep, make the straight edge match the straight edge of the-		
21	24	608.421	610.104	1.683		Of the amanemone?	
21	24	609.642	615.417	5.775	No no no no. You're right, you're right. Here, leave these together. But see how there's a straight edge here? Where's the straight edge on this piece?		
21	24	616.143	616.605	0.462		*noises*	
21	24	616.308	618.981	2.673	Yeah, so here, turn it so the straight edge matches		
21	24	619.806	620.862	1.056			
21	24	620.763	622.38	1.617	There! Good job!		
21	24	622.809	623.469	0.66		There

22	48	22.0	23.36	1.36	You turn it over and dump it		
22	48	22.8	23.28	0.48			Researcher Out
22	48	24.24	27.6	3.36		I- But I think it will stay together when we dump it out	
22	48	27.64	30.96	3.32	Yes, you're right it did stay together, so let's mess it up!		
22	48	33.32	35.88	2.56	*noises*		
22	48	33.76	35.84	2.08		*noises*

22	48	37.64	38.24	0.6	Hey what!		
22	48	39.32	42.96	3.64		I think that toucan's trying to eat a berry	
22	48	43.08	44.48	1.4	*laughing* Trying to eat a berry?		
22	48	44.52	47.6	3.08		Yeah because I think he likes berries so much!	
22	48	47.76	48.44	0.68	*laughing* Yeah?		
22	48	48.24	51.88	3.64		*noises*	
22	48	50.24	52.16	1.92	So, what's a good way to start the puzzle?		
22	48	53.28	54.92	1.64		Put the pieces where they go	
22	48	55.28	57.84	2.56	*laughing* Well yeah, that would be good, but how do you know that- where they go?		
22	48	60.16	62.84	2.68	What does Mommy always say? We should try and find the...		
22	48	60.56	63.6	3.04		*noises* ###	
22	48	64.48	65.36	0.88		Right piece!	
22	48	65.48	66.04	0.56	The...		
22	48	67.68	68.72	1.04	Ones with the...		
22	48	69.76	70.84	1.08	Edges, right?		
22	48	69.92	70.12	0.2			
22	48	71.0	73.12	2.12		Yeah	
22	48	73.04	74.6	1.56	Yeah, we should try and find the edges		
22	48	75.2	76.56	1.36		I'm thirsty	
22	48	77.12	80.48	3.36	Okay, go see in the- in the bag, see if you've got some #		
22	48	79.48	81.08	1.6		Mom what is this?

22	48	81.92	82.72	0.8		What is it?	
22	48	82.6	84.32	1.72	It's a, something for the computer		
22	48	85.52	86.68	1.16		But what is it?	
22	48	88.04	88.52	0.48	#		
22	48	88.04	89.32	1.28		Is it like a new mouse?	
22	48	89.44	91.96	2.52	It's like a mouse, yeah. Come on over let's put the puzzle together, come on		
22	48	93.4	94.12	0.72	There's your water		
22	48	97.48	99.8	2.32	Alright, let's find the edges, okay?		
22	48	104.56	106.84	2.28	No, come over here please, have a seat		
22	48	106.16	108.68	2.52		Can I put it? ####	
22	48	110.68	114.52	3.84		Can I ### see through that one # when I'm done	
22	48	114.64	117.08	2.44	We'll have to ask. We'll ask them, okay?		
22	48	117.92	120.32	2.4	Come on, help me turn them- puzzle pieces over		
22	48	119.0	123.64	4.64		Why were they be... in... next door?	
22	48	121.84	122.44	0.6	Okay		
22	48	124.08	127.6	3.52	I don't know. They just are. Okay here, you wanna help me put it together?		
22	48	128.8	129.68	0.88	Do those go together?		
22	48	132.04	133.56	1.52	Oh, we're missing pieces		
22	48	135.04	136.16	1.12	There's pieces under there		
22	48	136.72	137.36	0.64	'Kay		
22	48	139.16	141.48	2.32	I remember this guy was down here somewhere		
22	48	144.32	145.24	0.92	Oh there we go		
22	48	145.76	147.52	1.76	Maybe he wasn't down there, maybe her was up there		
22	48	153.12	153.8	0.68	What do ya think?		
22	48	154.84	155.72	0.88	Are you gonna do any?		
22	48	157.2	159.64	2.44	Why don't you start putting the piece togeth- the puzzle together?		
22	48	159.48	164.96	5.48		I- I stopped putting the puzzle together to drink my water	
22	48	164.88	166.72	1.84	*laughing* You sure did. That's okay		
22	48	167.6	169.6	2.0	I wonder if we could find a corner piece		
22	48	170.24	171.96	1.72		I- Where's the toys?	
22	48	172.6	173.28	0.68	I don't know		
22	48	174.0	175.88	1.88	Hey, is this one a corner piece?		
22	48	176.48	177.84	1.36		Mmm yes	
22	48	178.04	180.36	2.32	Yeah? So what do we think, should it go in that corner?		
22	48	181.64	184.8	3.16	Do we think goes in that corner, that corner		
22	48	185.8	187.4	1.6	'Kay, let's # it out		
22	48	186.48	192.48	6.0		Maybe... Maybe... It goes in that corner. It goes in that corner	
22	48	189.92	190.12	0.2			
22	48	192.6	195.44	2.84	Yeah? Goes in that corner? What about this one, where did that one go?		
22	48	196.6	200.8	4.2		I n- I'm going to drink for a little while	
22	48	201.08	203.68	2.6	Well, but let's put the put- puzzle together		
22	48	206.76	208.04	1.28	Where do you think that one would go?		
22	48	210.8	211.88	1.08	Yeah, there we go		
22	48	212.64	214.16	1.52	Where else is part of the butterfly?		
22	48	215.24	216.0	0.76		###	
22	48	216.68	217.92	1.24		In this picture	
22	48	216.72	219.92	3.2	'Bout that one? Yeah, where does that one go, you think?		
22	48	218.76	219.36	0.6		Um	
22	48	220.48	221.16	0.68		Hmm	
22	48	221.24	222.28	1.04	uh uh		
22	48	221.88	224.6	2.72		Maybe somewhere around the butterfly	
22	48	224.68	225.88	1.2	Where, maybe up here?		
22	48	227.84	228.68	0.84	Mmm		
22	48	228.96	230.84	1.88		Mmm, maybe	
22	48	230.96	232.36	1.4	Maybe we're not ready for that piece		
22	48	235.8	236.76	0.96	Ooh, What about this one?		
22	48	237.64	238.8	1.16	That goes there, huh?		
22	48	239.32	241.28	1.96		Mm-hmm	
22	48	242.08	243.64	1.56	That's an edge piece, right?		
22	48	246.32	247.68	1.36	Nope, that doesn't work		
22	48	249.16	249.76	0.6	Hmm		
22	48	251.36	251.88	0.52	*gasp*		
22	48	253.36	254.16	0.8	Does that go there?		
22	48	255.76	257.56	1.8		Think it does	
22	48	257.76	259.68	1.92	Sorta looks like it might, doesn't it?		
22	48	260.76	263.92	3.16	What else? Where else is there blue butterfly? What about that one?		
22	48	266.16	267.32	1.16	Does that have blue butterfly?		
22	48	271.4	272.32	0.92	Ooh, does that go?		
22	48	273.64	274.2	0.56		Yep!	
22	48	273.92	278.6	4.68	It does, but hmm. Is that right? Is that how a nose goes?		
22	48	278.88	280.12	1.24		No	
22	48	279.76	283.12	3.36	No, so we gotta turn it. Will you turn it so that it's facing the right way?		
22	48	283.88	287.28	3.4	No I think it's together, it's # the right way, but maybe this is in the wrong corner		
22	48	289.32	290.84	1.52	Maybe we should turn the puzzle		
22	48	293.4	295.28	1.88	Maybe it needs to go like that, huh?		
22	48	298.16	299.48	1.32	Yeah, ##		
22	48	298.48	300.16	1.68			
22	48	299.12	300.96	1.84		Think you're right, mama	
22	48	302.52	304.84	2.32	There's part of the butterfly, where's that go?		
22	48	302.76	303.68	0.92		Think you're right	
22	48	309.88	310.16	0.28			
22	48	310.2	311.92	1.72	Oh, good job, there you go		
22	48	311.2	314.12	2.92		What- What's that on the butterfly?	
22	48	313.4	315.44	2.04	Oh, that's not quite right though, is it?		
22	48	315.44	317.32	1.88		What's that on the butterfly?	
22	48	318.88	320.8	1.92	I don't know, but that one was not quite right		
22	48	322.32	323.0	0.68	What's that?		
22	48	323.44	324.64	1.2		A tiger	
22	48	326.16	327.12	0.96	Hmm		
22	48	327.76	330.2	2.44		A tiger it's a tiger	
22	48	330.12	331.28	1.16	That's not a tiger		
22	48	331.76	333.48	1.72		It's a tiger	
22	48	333.72	337.8	4.08	Here, come on, start putting some pieces together. Oh look, Hey- What's that?		
22	48	335.44	336.8	1.36		###	
22	48	337.96	338.8	0.84		A leopard	
22	48	338.8	341.28	2.48	Yeah, what else is- what- but what part of the leopard?		
22	48	346.56	349.56	3.0		The, uh, eye	
22	48	349.24	350.56	1.32	The eye, that's right		
22	48	350.84	352.4	1.56		The eye part of the leopard	
22	48	352.48	353.28	0.8	Yeah		
22	48	354.92	356.96	2.04	So where does the eye part of- go usually?		
22	48	357.0	357.6	0.6		*gasp*	
22	48	358.12	359.56	1.44	Above or below the nose?		
22	48	360.96	364.92	3.96		I found... A piece- some part of the butterfly	
22	48	365.8	367.48	1.68		But it doesn't go there	
22	48	367.44	370.88	3.44	Well try it, try it again, maybe it does. *gasp* You're right, it doesn't		
22	48	371.24	373.08	1.84	'Cause that's not butterfly, right?		
22	48	374.2	374.64	0.44	#		
22	48	374.2	378.72	4.52		Yeah but there's a part, butterfly in- on the edge	
22	48	379.6	380.88	1.28	Yeah, let's see		
22	48	381.44	382.24	0.8	Here look at this		
22	48	383.8	385.32	1.52		Can you push me in?	
22	48	385.36	387.12	1.76	Yeah, of course, buddy		
22	48	387.84	433.16	45.32		*noises*	
22	48	389.32	391.32	2.0	What's that part? Yeah, there you go		
22	48	394.96	396.52	1.56			
22	48	397.48	398.28	0.8	Hmm		
22	48	399.92	401.28	1.36	Okay, what else?		
22	48	403.16	405.04	1.88	You think maybe this'll fit in there now?		
22	48	407.28	407.92	0.64	Hmm		
22	48	408.92	411.24	2.32	No, it just doesn't, does it?		
22	48	412.2	414.28	2.08	Let's see, what else can we find of that leopard?		
22	48	420.56	421.04	0.48	Hmm		
22	48	434.16	435.52	1.36		What was that noise?	
22	48	435.92	436.8	0.88	I don't know		
22	48	437.24	439.0	1.76		*noises*	
22	48	440.56	443.0	2.44		Hmm, nope!	
22	48	443.28	444.04	0.76	Hmm		
22	48	449.32	453.28	3.96		That piece goes in like that, I think	
22	48	454.4	456.8	2.4		Hmm, maybe not	
22	48	457.64	459.08	1.44	Mmm, here's more leopard		
22	48	459.48	460.72	1.24	Are we missing some leopard?		
22	48	461.56	463.76	2.2	Oh, see we're missing some leopard, here		
22	48	464.72	466.16	1.44	There's another eyes		
22	48	473.84	477.0	3.16	There we go, now we got all the eyes		
22	48	480.04	481.12	1.08	There you go!		
22	48	480.88	482.28	1.4			
22	48	483.36	485.88	2.52	That's looking good, and look there's butterfly on that one!		
22	48	487.12	489.4	2.28			
22	48	489.44	490.64	1.2	Do you think they match up?		
22	48	490.8	491.4	0.6		Yep!	
22	48	491.52	494.12	2.6	So what about that piece? Does that piece match up over there?		
22	48	492.28	517.2	24.92		*noises*	
22	48	496.12	499.96	3.84	What do you think? Why don't you push it together?		
22	48	502.36	504.04	1.68	It did! It did!		
22	48	505.12	505.68	0.56	So		
22	48	506.08	507.48	1.4			
22	48	508.4	512.12	3.72	That does go there. How come it didn't work before? That was really weird		
22	48	513.28	517.48	4.2	Okay, what about, *gasp* Is that right?		
22	48	513.96	515.48	1.52			
22	48	517.64	518.4	0.76		Yep!	
22	48	518.28	518.96	0.68	Yep		
22	48	521.6	524.2	2.6	Oh, look at this piece, Oh, look at that!		
22	48	525.2	526.84	1.64			
22	48	525.64	526.6	0.96	Good job		
22	48	525.76	529.72	3.96		Uhh, that one was a little bit tricky	
22	48	529.68	530.92	1.24	That one was a little tricky		
22	48	531.76	534.92	3.16	I'm looking for another piece though, we're missing a piece		
22	48	535.44	536.56	1.12	That would go right there		
22	48	537.32	538.64	1.32	*gasp* maybe		
22	48	539.28	540.0	0.72	Look at that		
22	48	540.68	544.44	3.76	Why do I think that might work? What's shape- Does it match that shape? 		
22	48	543.84	552.52	8.68		Um, I think so. It sure does. Hey! That looks like part of a cow!	
22	48	545.08	546.6	1.52	You see the hole?		
22	48	545.76	547.28	1.52			
22	48	547.16	548.4	1.24	Yeah, sure does		
22	48	549.84	550.12	0.28			
22	48	549.88	550.6	0.72	Look at that		
22	48	552.68	556.2	3.52	Sure does. Hey, look, does that fit in that spot right there?		
22	48	554.64	559.92	5.28		*noises*	
22	48	558.16	559.4	1.24			
22	48	560.44	561.48	1.04	It does		
22	48	561.32	562.68	1.36		What's that?	
22	48	563.28	566.04	2.76	Looks like a leaf, a pretty flower, doe- Isn't it?		
22	48	565.96	569.6	3.64		*noises*	
22	48	567.44	571.2	3.76	Hmm, this looks like part of the cat, maybe, it's the rest of his what?		
22	48	570.56	572.16	1.6			
22	48	571.28	573.12	1.84		That... a leopard	
22	48	572.8	575.44	2.64	Oh sorry, the leopard, what's- What part of that, is it?		
22	48	576.0	578.44	2.44		Umm, His ear	
22	48	578.16	579.08	0.92	*laughing* His ear		
22	48	579.76	582.88	3.12		Now, let's see if this fits here	
22	48	583.8	584.96	1.16	Oh, nope		
22	48	584.04	584.92	0.88		Mmm	
22	48	587.6	589.2	1.6	Yeah, we know that fits together		
22	48	594.16	595.24	1.08	What about this over here?		
22	48	599.64	603.56	3.92	Now I remember the ants were kind of in- down below here somewhere		
22	48	604.08	605.04	0.96	Do you remember that?		
22	48	605.84	606.32	0.48		No	
22	48	606.48	606.92	0.44	No?		
22	48	609.08	611.8	2.72	What do we think that is? Is that- that's the toucan's #?		
22	48	611.96	612.56	0.6		Yeah

24	48	369.963	378.972	9.009	But look, this part, this part doesn't have cheetah on it, and the part that goes in here, has cheetah, so is there another cheetah piece missing?		
24	48	375.441	377.388	1.947		This is- But, This is	
24	48	381.942	383.823	1.881	You see any more pieces that have cheetah on them?

24	48	396.825	397.947	1.122		Yes	
24	48	397.749	405.702	7.953	Where does that one go? But wait! It's just a little bit- Look at this piece. This one just has a little bit of cheetah on the end. So where does that one go?		
24	48	406.329	407.418	1.089		Right there	
24	48	407.913	418.11	10.197	But this needs a whole cheetah part. So is there a little piece of cheetah? Maybe there or there or there? Where do you think that one goes?		
24	48	418.275	421.443	3.168		Goes right- Goes to here	
24	48	421.74	428.472	6.732	Well, I don't know, because the piece that goes here- Look NAME. The piece that goes here probably has a little cheetah and it also has blue butterfly

24	48	446.589	447.414	0.825		Right here

26	24	196.119	199.287	3.168	Let's look at that picture again so we can remember which corner piece goes where		
26	24	202.95	204.303	1.353	Alright, so it looks like-		
26	24	203.643	208.923	5.28		*noises*

26	24	317.427	319.143	1.716	Maybe those pieces do fit together		
26	24	321.552	326.931	5.379	If we line up the edges, maybe something will- *gasp* Alright, where do you think that should go?

26	24	744.249	746.328	2.079	So, let's see if we can figure out where they go		
26	24	746.856	748.341	1.485		We made the frame	
26	24	748.242	758.142	9.9	We did make the frame, and, it looks like this might be the easiest place to start, 'cause this- this octopus looks pretty, uh, pretty distinct. Can you see pieces of the octopus in here?

35	48	58.41	63.921	5.511	Turn- Turn 'em all so that the color is on the end- facing up. Like that, Kay?		
35	48	59.895	60.126	0.231			
35	48	64.779	66.297	1.518	Can you do these and these and these?

35	48	90.156	92.994	2.838		Where- Where do- Where do will they go?	
35	48	93.72	95.997	2.277	Let's figure that out, that's what we do with puzzles		
35	48	95.337	96.723	1.386		Where does this one go?	
35	48	97.218	99.594	2.376	Let's see. Let's turn 'em all upside-up first		
35	48	100.023	101.97	1.947	How 'bout this one, so we can see what we're looking at		
35	48	101.772	102.894	1.122		Where does it go?	
35	48	103.059	105.171	2.112	I don't know. I'll do this one		
35	48	105.567	106.26	0.693		Where?	
35	48	106.722	108.075	1.353	Where? Let's look. This one

35	48	116.325	117.579	1.254		Where does it go?	
35	48	117.348	119.031	1.683	Let's find out

35	48	125.169	131.505	6.336	Now, You know what I like to do? Is I like to start with the ones that have straight ends, like this		
35	48	126.093	126.885	0.792		Which one?	
35	48	131.505	133.584	2.079		Can you help me do this one?	
35	48	132.528	137.676	5.148	I s- I can help you. This has a straight end, and this one has a straight end		
35	48	139.194	140.316	1.122		Where does this one go?	
35	48	141.801	143.649	1.848	This one looks like it goes in a corner		
35	48	144.243	145.761	1.518	And that looks like it goes in a corner		
35	48	146.421	148.071	1.65		Where does this one go?	
35	48	149.655	151.338	1.683	Mmm, let's figure that out		
35	48	152.46	156.354	3.894	And this one has straight, this one has straight		
35	48	154.671	156.915	2.244		Where does this- this one go?	
35	48	156.981	159.786	2.805	Look. This one has straight, does it look kinda like that one?		
35	48	160.875	162.162	1.287	Do you think maybe they go together?		
35	48	162.888	164.505	1.617		What about this one too?	
35	48	164.703	167.772	3.069	Yeah. That- You're right. That probably goes close to this one		
35	48	168.498	170.214	1.716		This one. That one	
35	48	170.544	173.91	3.366	So let's try putting this one- 'Kay this one goes in the-		
35	48	173.514	180.312	6.798		And the- And the- That one goes to this one... And where should we put this one?	
35	48	179.85	180.147	0.297			
35	48	180.213	182.193	1.98	Try putting that one in that corner		
35	48	185.856	186.78	0.924	Can you turn it?		
35	48	189.156	189.783	0.627		Yeah	
35	48	190.146	191.07	0.924	Turn it a little more

35	48	208.692	210.804	2.112	And then fit it in the corner, good		
35	48	209.187	210.474	1.287			
35	48	212.883	216.414	3.531	And where was the other- This one we thought went close by		
35	48	217.536	218.724	1.188	Does that go nearby?		
35	48	220.044	220.737	0.693		Yeah!	
35	48	220.539	225.819	5.28	*gasp* *laughing* Well done. Does that one go close by?

35	48	242.418	253.209	10.791	Yo, good job! You know what? This one doesn't look like it quite matches. Let's, take that out for now and try another one. Maybe... which one, has these colors? Do you see a piece?		
35	48	254.166	255.321	1.155	That has those colors?		
35	48	256.146	257.07	0.924		Which one?	
35	48	258.027	260.106	2.079		With the- Where does this one go?	
35	48	261.624	265.782	4.158	That looks like it goes in another corner. Maybe in this corner? Or that corner?		
35	48	266.97	268.059	1.089	Or maybe this corner		
35	48	272.019	272.811	0.792		Right here	
35	48	273.009	273.999	0.99	You think it goes there?		
35	48	275.022	276.87	1.848		We can move a little right there	
35	48	276.969	277.695	0.726	'Kay		
35	48	278.553	279.576	1.023	Where do you think that goes?

35	48	293.766	296.703	2.937	Do you think it looks like it c- might go around there?		
35	48	297.792	298.749	0.957		Right here	
35	48	298.32	299.343	1.023	*gasp*

35	48	305.25	306.273	1.023	What about that one?		
35	48	315.909	316.767	0.858		I did it	
35	48	317.031	319.242	2.211	You did? It's close		
35	48	319.902	321.651	1.749	But I think it might go better up there		
35	48	323.697	324.621	0.924	Try turning it		
35	48	325.182	326.337	1.155		I did it	
35	48	326.535	332.904	6.369	*laughing* It's good but the colors don't quite go. Let's try turning it one more time, that way		
35	48	336.765	338.844	2.079		Where does- It goes right here	
35	48	337.59	338.712	1.122

35	48	348.249	349.965	1.716		Where does this one go?	
35	48	349.767	353.397	3.63	See here it's got a little bit of blue, like the blue over here		
35	48	354.42	355.476	1.056			
35	48	355.74	356.829	1.089	Good

35	48	386.364	387.882	1.518	Put the blue close to the blue		
35	48	392.271	392.931	0.66	###		
35	48	393.525	394.845	1.32		Where is it?	
35	48	395.076	397.089	2.013	Let's see, where's the bl- Where's the blue over here?

35	48	464.64	466.95	2.31	Is there another piece that has an eye?		
35	48	468.171	470.25	2.079	Do you see any of these pieces that have an eye?		
35	48	472.857	473.418	0.561		This one

37	48	359.898	365.409	5.511	Okay, here's the piece. I think it might go along this flat edge		
37	48	366.003	368.907	2.904		*noises*	
37	48	369.435	372.306	2.871	Okay, NAME. Do you wanna have time to play with the other toys?		
37	48	372.339	373.164	0.825		Yeah	
37	48	372.933	374.55	1.617	Great. Let's keep working then		
37	48	373.791	376.695	2.904		But first I wanna play hide and seek in the other room!

37	48	378.378	380.391	2.013	Okay, where does it go?		
37	48	380.16	383.757	3.597		Ooh

37	48	394.746	396.792	2.046	Do you see a piece with some bright blue on it?		
37	48	398.112	398.937	0.825		Where?	
37	48	398.706	399.564	0.858	Look around

37	48	403.623	410.982	7.359		*noises*	
37	48	410.19	411.411	1.221			
37	48	411.213	413.754	2.541	Great, now what animal are we working on?		
37	48	414.447	416.394	1.947	What is it- What animal has spots?		
37	48	416.229	417.087	0.858		Cheetah	
37	48	417.219	420.585	3.366	Cheetah? Could be. Okay let's find the cheetah pieces		
37	48	418.506	422.697	4.191		*noises*	
37	48	422.037	424.611	2.574	### and let's find all the pieces with spots		
37	48	424.281	426.888	2.607		Why does she have a camera like that?	
37	48	426.756	433.653	6.897	Because they're taping, um, you and me, and they want to see how we do a puzzle together		
37	48	435.567	437.679	2.112		Why do they have that camera?	
37	48	437.712	439.131	1.419	That's just the kind they have		
37	48	440.154	440.715	0.561		Oh	
37	48	440.913	441.573	0.66	Mm-hmm		
37	48	443.553	445.764	2.211	Okay, these look like cheetah pieces		
37	48	448.899	455.763	6.864	Okay. Ooh, I think I see part of the nose. Do you see his little red- orangeish nose?		
37	48	459.327	460.548	1.221			
37	48	460.812	461.967	1.155	Good		
37	48	461.934	463.254	1.32		Now ###	
37	48	463.749	468.27	4.521	Oh, we're- Is the frog next? Looks like this might be a snake's head, but-		
37	48	469.59	488.565	18.975		I think it might go *noises* I guess we're not ready for that piece	
37	48	488.103	488.862	0.759	Yeah		
37	48	489.654	491.403	1.749	Um, do you see some eyes?		
37	48	493.251	494.043	0.792		Where?	
37	48	493.878	498.828	4.95	This looks like part of his green eye, and I see another piece with some other eyes		
37	48	502.656	503.283	0.627	That's it		
37	48	509.784	514.734	4.95		*noises* *whining* I can't do it	
37	48	513.084	520.08	6.996	### Look, look, look at this piece right here. Look at this piece right here. And look a this, maybe they connect		
37	48	521.631	523.083	1.452	Turn it the other way		
37	48	526.152	527.076	0.924	Keep turning		
37	48	528.363	529.518	1.155	That's it		
37	48	528.726	529.881	1.155			
37	48	530.64	537.372	6.732	Wow, and, so we need another big green eye, part of the cheetah. And I think I see just the piece		
37	48	538.131	539.781	1.65	See how this is part of his eye?		
37	48	541.2	542.652	1.452	Where's the other part of his eye?		
37	48	542.85	543.873	1.023		Mmm	
37	48	543.675	545.094	1.419	I think it's on the board here		
37	48	545.952	546.843	0.891	Yes		
37	48	547.503	548.757	1.254			
37	48	548.625	551.958	3.333	Good! It's coming along		
37	48	553.245	554.664	1.419	Where do you think that could go?		
37	48	553.905	554.169	0.264			
37	48	557.205	558.36	1.155	Try a different spot		
37	48	561.726	568.557	6.831	Do you see another kind of... cut-out hole, where some- yes.		
37	48	569.679	570.702	1.023			
37	48	570.966	572.352	1.386	Very good		
37	48	572.451	574.992	2.541		Now can we play hide-and-seek?	
37	48	574.101	576.84	2.739	Well, we have to finish this puzzle and one more		
37	48	579.942	581.031	1.089		And then go?	
37	48	580.965	581.922	0.957	*laughing* Yeah		
37	48	582.78	588.885	6.105	Let's see. Umm, see how this has- it's kinda yellow with black spots?		
37	48	590.106	594.363	4.257	Where on the puzzle do you see some yellow and black spots that needs finishing?		
37	48	599.577	601.755	2.178	That's it. That's it		
37	48	601.656	603.009	1.353			
37	48	603.504	608.718	5.214	Ooh and I think I see part of a snake's head up above. That's kind of exciting		
37	48	609.543	611.853	2.31	Let's see, is there more of the snake?		
37	48	612.711	615.813	3.102	Ooh, this looks like part of a snake		
37	48	620.928	622.281	1.353		Ta-da!	
37	48	621.885	623.304	1.419	*laughing* What's that?		
37	48	624.459	627.231	2.772		###	
37	48	624.624	627.495	2.871	Uh-huh, it's a little too close for me to see it like that		
37	48	630.564	639.111	8.547	I'm not sure where that piece goes. W- Here's how, um, I think we can finish the puzzle. If we go animal by animal. So right now, we're working on-		
37	48	639.342	644.16	4.818	We're finishing up this cheetah, and also we can work on the big snake up here. That's part of his head		
37	48	644.325	646.008	1.683		But I see teeth	
37	48	646.206	647.196	0.99	I do too		
37	48	647.394	653.07	5.676		Maybe it's, um, a dra- Maybe it's a crocodile	
37	48	653.202	655.743	2.541	Let's keep building the puzzle and then we'll see for sure		
37	48	656.931	661.32	4.389	Um, I think this looks like part of the snake. And also this		
37	48	663.432	667.491	4.059	You wanna see if there's a way it can go to build the snake more?		
37	48	669.141	671.055	1.914	Maybe not there. Try a different spot		
37	48	673.134	675.411	2.277		I want you to do it	
37	48	674.091	677.556	3.465	Well you're doing it. They wanna see how you do it. How we do it together		
37	48	678.645	680.229	1.584		How	
37	48	678.975	680.361	1.386	That's it. That's it		
37	48	680.592	681.714	1.122			
37	48	681.318	682.308	0.99	You just did it		
37	48	683.034	683.661	0.627	Super		
37	48	684.651	685.344	0.693	Okay		
37	48	685.542	685.938	0.396		Um	
37	48	688.611	689.205	0.594	Alright		
37	48	689.733	694.617	4.884	We're making good progress. Do you see this piece? And how it has a flat piece on top?		
37	48	694.881	696.63	1.749		*noises*	
37	48	696.531	698.346	1.815	This might go at the very top		
37	48	699.567	702.075	2.508		*noises*	
37	48	701.316	703.428	2.112	Might have to kneel up a little bit		
37	48	704.319	705.606	1.287			
37	48	704.649	705.441	0.792	That's it		
37	48	706.068	710.952	4.884	Great. Now, this gives us a place to start building the top, too!		
37	48	708.246	708.807	0.561		###	
37	48	710.292	715.44	5.148		*noises*	
37	48	713.625	717.75	4.125	Okay, Um, Let's see, Where-		
37	48	716.364	720.753	4.389		*noises* ###	
37	48	720.159	723.888	3.729	We need more of the snake, and we need more of this cheetah		
37	48	722.568	724.548	1.98		### one	
37	48	724.878	735.669	10.791		*noises* *singing* butterfly, butterfly, butter- butter- butterfly, butterfly	
37	48	725.175	726.363	1.188	There's nothing under here		
37	48	727.617	733.326	5.709	Let's see. This looks like part of a cheetah. See how p- it's part of a spot?		
37	48	742.335	743.358	1.023			
37	48	743.094	744.117	1.023	Mm-hmm		
37	48	744.447	747.318	2.871		What's he do? What's *name* doing?	
37	48	747.021	750.981	3.96	I think he's just playing with some toys in there. Okay look at this big green leaf here		
37	48	751.476	755.172	3.696	This looks like part of that leaf and this looks like part of a leaf		
37	48	758.109	759.231	1.122	Try a different way		
37	48	759.429	763.686	4.257		*noises* Oh	
37	48	763.092	766.953	3.861	Yep. Probably that got torn. Okay, let's try to turn it a little bit		
37	48	768.075	769.164	1.089	That's it		
37	48	774.345	775.335	0.99	Good		
37	48	777.678	780.714	3.036	That's it, right there. You found the right place		
37	48	783.387	785.664	2.277		*noises*	
37	48	783.717	784.938	1.221	Well at least I thought you did		
37	48	787.38	796.62	9.24	You know what? Mommy is wrong. It looks like it goes there, doesn't it? But it actually doesn't. So let's try this piece. Let's see if this piece fits		
37	48	792.165	797.412	5.247		*noises*	
37	48	793.881	794.112	0.231			
37	48	798.171	799.26	1.089			
37	48	798.897	800.019	1.122	That fits		
37	48	800.514	802.56	2.046	Okay, so this must go somewhere else		
37	48	803.286	804.111	0.825	Umm		
37	48	806.52	810.381	3.861	Hmm, okay. This looks like- What animal do you think these belong to?		
37	48	811.437	812.196	0.759	Any ideas?		
37	48	816.948	821.733	4.785	Maybe a little tree frog. Okay, what- What is this animal that likes to eat leaves?		
37	48	823.977	824.472	0.495	Hmm?		
37	48	827.277	828.102	0.825	What could that be?		
37	48	828.993	830.049	1.056		A crab	
37	48	830.379	831.105	0.726	Crab?		
37	48	831.798	841.5	9.702	Well, it's kind of reddish like some of our pictures of crabs, but I think it's an ant. Let's get all the ant pieces together and see if we can do the ant		
37	48	831.897	833.349	1.452		Cra-	
37	48	840.048	842.655	2.607		*noises*

37	48	860.838	864.468	3.63	Well, could this be part of the ant? Maybe that's part of his mouth		
37	48	864.732	865.986	1.254			
37	48	865.821	869.847	4.026	Mmm, okay. And look at these pieces, I think they're the legs		
37	48	870.837	871.959	1.122	Where could that piece go?		
37	48	877.8	878.592	0.792	That's it		
37	48	879.384	880.473	1.089			
37	48	880.176	880.803	0.627	Good		
37	48	881.595	882.519	0.924	How bout this piece?		
37	48	886.974	888.129	1.155			
37	48	887.997	888.657	0.66	Good		
37	48	889.416	893.013	3.597	Alright, any more ant pieces? We're making great progress		
37	48	893.871	895.29	1.419	Umm		
37	48	899.646	900.702	1.056	Okay

37	48	904.761	905.421	0.66	###		
37	48	904.893	906.378	1.485		Think there's only two	
37	48	907.005	911.163	4.158	Well something must go here, something kind of reddish. Oh- This one		
37	48	911.196	912.681	1.485			
37	48	912.648	915.948	3.3	Okay, now we're on the red, umm		
37	48	913.836	914.1	0.264			15:00 - 22 Pieces
37	48	919.809	922.68	2.871	The red plant. That's it. Where could this go?		
37	48	919.908	921.063	1.155			
37	48	922.977	924.132	1.155			
37	48	924.0	930.831	6.831	Making great progress. Okay. Now, we're gonna- We could go up here, or let's ### look for this big green-		
37	48	930.699	933.306	2.607		### what's this ###	
37	48	933.735	944.229	10.494	Looks like some bird is eating a cherry or something. Look at this leaf. You see how there's green leaf both of these places? Maybe this piece goes around here

37	24	1725.669	1730.355	4.686		I wish I was at the aq- aquarium to see a octopus squirt ink	
37	24	1729.827	1733.985	4.158	I would love to see that too. I've never actually seen one squirt ink before		
37	24	1731.444	1731.906	0.462		###	
37	24	1734.051	1736.031	1.98		And what would you say if it did?	
37	24	1734.612	1735.899	1.287			
37	24	1735.602	1737.153	1.551	If it squirted ink on me?		
37	24	1737.12	1737.813	0.693		What?	
37	24	1737.681	1743.555	5.874	"Mmm, I think I'd say, ""I've gotta get this ink off of me. I have to get- get a washdown"""		
37	24	1744.05	1750.122	6.072		No! A glass wall around the octopus	
37	24	1749.198	1755.534	6.336	Oh, then you're right it couldn't squirt me. I thought you said it- like if I was swimming, doing deep-sea diving		
37	24	1756.425	1757.118	0.693	But you're right		
37	24	1758.042	1761.111	3.069	I had a- There's a glass wall. He couldn't squirt me		
37	24	1761.804	1764.378	2.574		Um, then where's more of it?	
37	24	1764.642	1765.533	0.891	More of what?		
37	24	1766.094	1767.183	1.089		This	
37	24	1767.15	1771.11	3.96	Well I think you- Well let's see, We are missing- There- There's a few-		
37	24	1772.298	1775.07	2.772	### This looks like it's something		
37	24	1775.697	1777.215	1.518	Purple and purple		
37	24	1779.921	1781.142	1.221	You see that straight edge?		
37	24	1781.967	1783.056	1.089	That means something		
37	24	1784.442	1785.96	1.518	It means it goes along an edge		
37	24	1788.699	1790.349	1.65	Maybe you're not ready for that piece yet		
37	24	1791.075	1791.801	0.726		###	
37	24	1791.108	1793.451	2.343	Maybe this piece has to go first		
37	24	1794.309	1795.266	0.957			
37	24	1801.899	1802.889	0.99	Mm-hmm

37	24	1805.727	1807.377	1.65	What do you think this creature is?		
37	24	1810.545	1812.492	1.947		I don't know	
37	24	1814.043	1816.056	2.013	Well, what color is it?		
37	24	1822.095	1824.702	2.607		Orange	
37	24	1822.524	1826.22	3.696	Mm-hmm. Let's find some more orange pieces to see if they connect		
37	24	1828.497	1830.411	1.914		What's this blue?	
37	24	1830.708	1833.81	3.102	Umm... I th-		
37	24	1840.707	1843.545	2.838	Actually, is this part of this gray?		
37	24	1848.924	1850.376	1.452			
37	24	1850.541	1852.587	2.046	Might be part of a swordfish		
37	24	1855.689	1856.415	0.726		Yeah	
37	24	1856.712	1857.537	0.825	Mmkay		
37	24	1858.296	1860.177	1.881		*noises*	
37	24	1859.055	1862.652	3.597	We're getting there. Here's some blue. You wanna work on the swordfish?		
37	24	1863.51	1864.17	0.66	Blue?		
37	24	1864.797	1865.82	1.023		I don't want to	
37	24	1865.853	1868.691	2.838	We're almost finished. Let's finish up, then we'll be all done		
37	24	1866.348	1866.678	0.33		###	
37	24	1869.978	1886.379	16.401		*noises*	
37	24	1881.363	1882.749	1.386			
37	24	1882.914	1883.574	0.66	Nice		
37	24	1885.059	1886.742	1.683	Where do you think this piece could go?		
37	24	1887.6	1888.755	1.155			
37	24	1888.788	1890.207	1.419	Yeah		
37	24	1891.395	1892.55	1.155	Coming along!		
37	24	1893.111	1895.355	2.244		Maybe it's afraid of the shark	
37	24	1895.949	1900.668	4.719	Maybe. It has a nice big pointy sword thing in front		
37	24	1899.117	1902.252	3.135		Maybe it- Maybe it could poke an octopus	
37	24	1901.955	1902.912	0.957	Maybe it could		
37	24	1903.44	1904.1	0.66		Yeah	
37	24	1904.1	1910.601	6.501	Uh-huh, Okay so I think you- Do you wanna work on this orange? Or do you wanna work on the blue? What- What's next?		
37	24	1904.925	1905.123	0.198			
37	24	1909.644	1912.086	2.442		### shark ### to try to	
37	24	1913.538	1914.528	0.99		eat it	
37	24	1914.66	1915.353	0.693	Mm-hmm		
37	24	1915.155	1917.168	2.013		Maybe um, it would poke at it	
37	24	1917.399	1922.712	5.313	May- Exactly. It could be like a protective, um, device		
37	24	1923.042	1923.9	0.858		Yeah	
37	24	1924.032	1929.345	5.313	Okay, I see some purples missing with this, little um, is that a sea anemone?		
37	24	1930.071	1932.546	2.475	And maybe this little purple could be part of it		
37	24	1934.757	1935.912	1.155			
37	24	1936.308	1938.948	2.64	Oh, it's coming along! Okay		
37	24	1939.74	1940.763	1.023	What could go here?		
37	24	1941.291	1944.096	2.805		Now i wanna sit on your la-	
37	24	1943.337	1943.931	0.594	Alright		
37	24	1951.191	1952.181	0.99		Now what?	
37	24	1952.313	1954.887	2.574	Well, you tell me. We're getting there		
37	24	1956.966	1958.022	1.056	What- What could go here?		
37	24	1958.88	1959.771	0.891	That's it		
37	24	1961.949	1963.104	1.155			
37	24	1963.038	1963.731	0.693	Nice		
37	24	1964.82	1967.196	2.376	Okay, any other orange pieces?		
37	24	1968.615	1968.912	0.297		Uh

37	24	1982.508	1984.092	1.584	Your puzzle's more than half-way done!		
37	24	1992.045	1998.315	6.27	Well y- I do see pink there, but since this has a flat edge, it probably has to go over here		
37	24	1999.899	2004.189	4.29	Probably right around there. Why don't you find another piece with pink that could maybe go in the middle		
37	24	2006.103	2008.017	1.914	That looks like a corner piece		
37	24	2008.941	2010.03	1.089			
37	24	2009.799	2013.99	4.191	So there's probably something that goes in between and connects these two		
37	24	2017.455	2019.963	2.508		Maybe this	
37	24	2019.501	2024.385	4.884	Well this doesn't have a flat edge. Why don't you see if it could connect with the pink over here		
37	24	2028.576	2031.447	2.871	Ooh, that looks- That looks good because see the blue?		
37	24	2030.358	2031.777	1.419			
37	24	2032.239	2036.76	4.521	Mm-hmm. And then maybe this goes down here like that		
37	24	2037.915	2038.806	0.891	We'll see		
37	24	2039.499	2040.093	0.594		But	
37	24	2039.928	2041.314	1.386	Or maybe it goes up here		
37	24	2042.172	2044.581	2.409	Maybe it's the top. That's it		
37	24	2045.307	2046.594	1.287			
37	24	2047.881	2048.64	0.759	Great		
37	24	2055.306	2057.286	1.98		What does this go to?	
37	24	2058.144	2060.586	2.442	Well, is that the head of a seahorse?		
37	24	2060.718	2061.939	1.221			
37	24	2066.328	2067.516	1.188	Mm-hmm

37	24	2074.875	2075.568	0.693	Nice		
37	24	2081.013	2081.838	0.825		Maybe um	
37	24	2083.29	2085.303	2.013		I'm working on a whale	
37	24	2085.204	2086.128	0.924	Yes		
37	24	2089.857	2092.134	2.277	Do you see this little bit of pink?		
37	24	2094.543	2095.698	1.155			
37	24	2094.675	2095.5	0.825	That's it

38	48	64.845	67.551	2.706		First we gotta take the puzzle-	
38	48	67.848	69.135	1.287	Okay		
38	48	69.432	73.854	4.422		Break them *laughing* Then we gotta mix them up	
38	48	73.458	74.349	0.891	Okay		
38	48	79.068	80.388	1.32	Alrighty		
38	48	79.563	83.721	4.158		But ### we take the pieces out

38	48	96.063	100.155	4.092		A lot of pieces, because they're so little and tiny

38	48	122.892	123.123	0.231			
38	48	124.707	126.588	1.881	Those are the mints. I don't think you like those		
38	48	129.228	129.987	0.759	You want one?		
38	48	130.845	131.439	0.594	Okay

38	48	139.689	141.834	2.145	Because I'm a big person. Let's go		
38	48	143.451	144.606	1.155	So, where should we start?		
38	48	145.167	146.223	1.056	Let's see		
38	48	145.959	146.652	0.693		Up here!	
38	48	146.718	147.312	0.594	Up here?		
38	48	147.675	152.889	5.214	So how do we know what goes up there? Ooh, I just remember it's a jungle and a bunch of animals		
38	48	154.11	160.908	6.798	Well, I don't know, this probably goes at the top, but I don't think it goes over there. Right, 'cause it has a flat top?		
38	48	162.723	164.406	1.683	So what else has a flat top?		
38	48	165.099	167.013	1.914		Uhh, this!	
38	48	167.079	168.3	1.221	Okay, let's see		
38	48	171.699	174.075	2.376	Alright, some more flat- any more flat tops?		
38	48	175.725	178.662	2.937	Oh, I have some more. What about that one? Where might that one go?		
38	48	180.51	184.437	3.927	### has a- Yeah, so that one would go in the corner. Nice		
38	48	185.559	189.651	4.092	Hmm. You- You have some, well we got a lot of flat pieces		
38	48	190.278	191.004	0.726		This one	
38	48	190.278	191.631	1.353	### this one, I don't know		
38	48	192.621	194.568	1.947	Let's see. Is that a flat top?		
38	48	200.541	202.686	2.145	I'm not sure if this one goes at the top or the bottom		
38	48	203.775	204.534	0.759	Hmm		
38	48	207.273	208.395	1.122	And this one too		
38	48	210.012	212.751	2.739	Oh well, Hmm, this one looks like a flower?		
38	48	213.939	216.183	2.244		I think these go together	
38	48	224.235	224.829	0.594	Hmm		
38	48	229.746	234.696	4.95	Well, it was a good idea. Not quite, but that's a good idea. Should we find some more of those?		
38	48	235.587	237.501	1.914	Do we have any more of those with the red?		
38	48	238.557	240.57	2.013	Let's put 'em all together so we can see 'em		
38	48	242.418	244.959	2.541	And this one- Yeah, this one red too		
38	48	242.781	243.507	0.726		Red

38	48	257.004	257.565	0.561	Nope		
38	48	262.119	267.3	5.181	Oh this- Oh yeah it doesn't. This has these little pointy pieces. Does one of those fit over there?		
38	48	271.293	272.877	1.584	Mmm, try it the other way		
38	48	276.54	277.464	0.924	Nope		
38	48	278.586	279.972	1.386	Nope, see that doesn't match		
38	48	280.962	282.447	1.485	You got one side left		
38	48	283.602	285.417	1.815		This one ###

38	48	293.403	294.294	0.891		This one	
38	48	294.261	296.241	1.98	You think that one? Okay, we'll start there		
38	48	296.637	300.564	3.927	How 'bout, aah, is some more red pieces, or, here's some more		
38	48	302.478	303.402	0.924		it's ###	
38	48	303.831	306.207	2.376	Well this looks like the same kind of plant		
38	48	308.517	310.431	1.914		We can't do this puzzle	
38	48	311.058	314.358	3.3	Well, do you wanna s- try putting something else together, maybe the leopard?		
38	48	315.48	316.272	0.792	Mmkay		
38	48	317.262	321.585	4.323	Let's put that little froggy to the side, and put this on the side

41	48	1228.194	1228.623	0.429		Yeah	
41	48	1229.877	1237.236	7.359		I- I do like butterflies, but sometimes big butterflies got eyes up	
41	48	1237.335	1241.625	4.29	Okay, now we need to find the piece there. I think this might be it. Let's try that piece		
41	48	1243.077	1244.166	1.089	I don't know, that's not it		
41	48	1244.76	1245.684	0.924	'Cause you know why?

41	48	1263.768	1267.2	3.432		Turn it around- It go with the butterfly right-	
41	48	1266.606	1269.345	2.739	Right, I think it goes like that. Try it that way		
41	48	1268.487	1268.982	0.495		Yeah	
41	48	1269.444	1270.434	0.99		Try it that way?	
41	48	1270.302	1270.896	0.594	Mm-hmm

41	48	1279.443	1284.393	4.95		We can put- We can um, I think this go right-	
41	48	1285.35	1286.571	1.221	maybe it goes on that side		
41	48	1286.34	1289.706	3.366		Sometimes something's missing right there	
41	48	1288.815	1290.927	2.112	Something's missing right there. You are right		
41	48	1292.874	1312.509	19.635		Oh I know. I know mama. It go right- I know mama, because, some points, um, these are not doing good because then those- those will go the other side and the other one's in the way

41	48	1327.194	1328.712	1.518	You're right. It goes right here		
41	48	1328.778	1329.405	0.627		Yeah	
41	48	1329.801	1331.748	1.947	It looks like it goes there, but it doesn't		
41	48	1332.309	1336.236	3.927		Yeah, Mama. The nose supposed to be r-i-	
41	48	1334.388	1334.916	0.528	S-

41	48	1345.014	1347.555	2.541		Maybe we got it wrong	
41	48	1347.225	1350.855	3.63	Right, 'cause there's an ant... right there		
41	48	1351.35	1355.178	3.828		And the ant supposed to be the other way	
41	48	1355.97	1358.379	2.409	Now where's the other piece? With the butterfly		
41	48	1357.422	1358.181	0.759		I got it	
41	48	1360.161	1360.887	0.726		Mama

41	48	1377.882	1378.872	0.99	But

41	48	1405.305	1405.866	0.561		And	
41	48	1411.971	1412.499	0.528	See?

41	48	1467.279	1471.833	4.554	Like that. We need to find the piece with the green. It's not that piece

45	48	605.649	607.662	2.013		I wanna try to work on here	
45	48	607.728	609.741	2.013	The beautiful toucan		
45	48	610.764	612.744	1.98	So there's a blue butterfly here, and a-

45	48	623.997	629.343	5.346	It did. It came out in one solid piece. But let's take it apart and um, separate the pieces		
45	48	629.871	630.597	0.726		*noises*	
45	48	631.554	635.448	3.894		So I have to two- do two games with her and then I get the toy?	
45	48	635.217	636.339	1.122	Mm-hmm I think so		
45	48	636.636	640.662	4.026		*noises* Is that really gonna be one whole hour?	
45	48	641.685	642.51	0.825		One hour?	
45	48	642.543	646.635	4.092	Aah, I think the- the two games you're gonna play with her will take less than an hour		
45	48	646.899	647.13	0.231			
45	48	647.625	650.958	3.333	But all together the amount of time we'll be here is about an hour

45	48	657.855	661.815	3.96		How- Why was it only just puzzle and puzzle and puzzles?	
45	48	661.551	666.798	5.247	I think they're learning something about how you solve- solve puzzles and how you-		
45	48	670.032	670.923	0.891	How you work		
45	48	671.913	677.622	5.709	Aah, but I think next time we're gonna do something with books. Today it's puzzles		
45	48	679.272	683.76	4.488		Like, when I'm five or six or s- I might be six or-	
45	48	683.034	689.799	6.765	I think we're coming- I think it's next weekend, and you're gonna be a little bit closer to five, but still not five quite yet		
45	48	694.518	702.504	7.986		Like two, two day- two days and one, and like three weeks? Or something?	
45	48	703.131	707.454	4.323	Yeah, I think Poppa said yesterday that you're three days and two weeks away		
45	48	708.741	711.546	2.805	Maybe now you're only two days and two weeks away from being-		
45	48	714.087	715.275	1.188	So where do you wanna start?		
45	48	717.288	719.169	1.881	You said you wanted to start with the toucan?		
45	48	719.697	721.611	1.914		Yeah	
45	48	720.621	722.568	1.947	Should we try to find pieces of him?

45	48	756.855	759.99	3.135		It's 'cause they're small, so, that does not go there	
45	48	759.792	761.871	2.079	Oh good corner		
45	48	759.957	760.848	0.891			
45	48	762.432	764.907	2.475	It makes things easier when you find a corner piece		
45	48	765.501	767.613	2.112		Yeah so we ### along the edges	
45	48	765.93	766.854	0.924

45	48	782.265	783.255	0.99			
45	48	785.532	786.885	1.353		###	
45	48	786.258	788.931	2.673	It's a little bit stuck, I think. Yeah, there

45	48	809.226	810.216	0.99	*laughing*		
45	48	811.305	814.605	3.3		They have mouths like that, and so do lions	
45	48	814.341	815.067	0.726	###		
45	48	815.199	821.106	5.907		They have big noses, they have really good sense. Really big, and really good senses	
45	48	822.327	825.066	2.739		Some big animals don't have good senses ###

45	48	860.574	861.927	1.353		Okay	
45	48	868.263	870.111	1.848		I can't figure this-	
45	48	870.243	872.091	1.848	Hmm, it looks like part of an eye		
45	48	872.289	872.949	0.66		Yeah	
45	48	873.972	876.942	2.97		Like somehow here?	
45	48	876.183	877.239	1.056	That might be the other eye?		
45	48	878.097	878.856	0.759	Do you think?		
45	48	880.341	882.288	1.947	### 'Cause he's gonna have two eyes, I think		
45	48	885.093	886.743	1.65		These are ###	
45	48	886.875	887.172	0.297

45	48	897.336	900.24	2.904		Is it a tiger or not a tiger?	
45	48	899.745	903.012	3.267	I think it's a leopard, when they have spots like that, I think that's a leopard		
45	48	899.811	900.603	0.792			
45	48	901.989	905.289	3.3		A leopard. Are those leopards fast?	
45	48	905.256	905.85	0.594	Yes

45	48	922.02	923.109	1.089		###	
45	48	926.31	930.567	4.257	We still need to finish the top of his head. Oh that's good, that's the side of his head		
45	48	927.63	928.455	0.825			
45	48	932.085	933.867	1.782		Top of his head

45	48	946.143	953.964	7.821	You know what's funny, I see? Those look like the little aah, feet of a frog, maybe? Or a- some other creature		
45	48	947.694	948.123	0.429		Hmm	
45	48	954.129	956.604	2.475		A snail ###	
45	48	958.65	960.168	1.518	Maybe we should look for more of those		
45	48	961.356	962.181	0.825		Mmm	
45	48	966.405	968.22	1.815		Don't see-	
45	48	968.814	970.332	1.518	Or do you wanna try another corner?		
45	48	970.464	978.681	8.217		Umm, try another corner. There are three more corners and aah, three more edges	
45	48	979.011	980.562	1.551	Can you find a corner piece?		
45	48	980.232	988.647	8.415		No we have one more edge, we have one more edge! 'Cause we already started on this, and this, but not this

45	48	1004.85	1011.912	7.062	There's a lot of green here. We might want to choose a strategy. Either do corners, do edges-		
45	48	1014.816	1019.502	4.686	Try to finish up the mushrooms here, maybe? You see these mushrooms?		
45	48	1017.852	1019.205	1.353		Mmm, yeah	
45	48	1020.921	1024.551	3.63		I found more ### *noises*

45	48	1030.26	1032.834	2.574		###	
45	48	1033.296	1036.959	3.663	I think that might be a frog. Do you see any more pieces that look like that?		
45	48	1035.144	1035.969	0.825		Frog	
45	48	1037.388	1038.18	0.792		No	
45	48	1038.906	1041.546	2.64		Surprisingly not- Oh here	
45	48	1043.46	1045.836	2.376		Is some frog	
45	48	1047.024	1048.443	1.419		This must go-	
45	48	1049.928	1052.337	2.409	I can't see that whole piece. What kind of piece is that?		
45	48	1052.403	1053.03	0.627		A corner!	
45	48	1053.129	1053.822	0.693	Yeah		
45	48	1053.657	1054.482	0.825		It must go up-	
45	48	1055.373	1056.297	0.924	That's a good guess		
45	48	1057.947	1058.376	0.429		Or	
45	48	1060.818	1064.58	3.762	Mmm then- I think the one you chose was good because otherwise he'll be upside-down		
45	48	1067.319	1069.002	1.683		And this wouldn't work	
45	48	1069.068	1070.982	1.914	That's right. That wouldn't work		
45	48	1070.19	1070.718	0.528		So	
45	48	1073.028	1073.787	0.759			
45	48	1075.305	1077.087	1.782	Do you see any other froggy pieces?		
45	48	1077.351	1078.638	1.287		Mmm	
45	48	1080.156	1081.476	1.32		More tentacle things	
45	48	1083.126	1085.568	2.442		###	
45	48	1084.71	1086.459	1.749	I don't think that's the same-		
45	48	1087.482	1090.122	2.64		Yeah, those have big dots	
45	48	1090.254	1090.881	0.627	Right		
45	48	1091.211	1093.026	1.815		Those are some kind of snail	
45	48	1094.049	1094.808	0.759		###	
45	48	1097.349	1098.075	0.726		Aah	
45	48	1100.451	1103.949	3.498	What about these, are those frog pieces?		
45	48	1101.87	1102.596	0.726		Okay	
45	48	1104.147	1104.873	0.726			
45	48	1105.863	1106.688	0.825		Yeah	
45	48	1106.754	1107.645	0.891			
45	48	1107.711	1108.338	0.627	Good		
45	48	1109.064	1111.77	2.706		Now I need a ### here	
45	48	1115.829	1121.076	5.247		We're done with the ### *noises*	
45	48	1122.231	1126.917	4.686	You know what we started to- we started to do I think over here? Do you see this?		
45	48	1125.432	1125.993	0.561		Mm-hmm	
45	48	1126.851	1127.115	0.264			
45	48	1127.94	1128.996	1.056	Pretty red		
45	48	1129.227	1129.986	0.759		Mm-hmm	
45	48	1130.085	1133.088	3.003	Do you think we could find more ### pieces?		
45	48	1131.603	1133.946	2.343		Ant, red ants ###	
45	48	1133.781	1140.018	6.237	Those- Do you see- I feel like that's a little bit of a different color red. This is more of a bright red- Yes		
45	48	1138.599	1139.589	0.99		Pinky-red	
45	48	1140.678	1144.374	3.696	And I wonder if some of these go in that area		
45	48	1150.446	1152.129	1.683	That's good, you're looking for an edge		
45	48	1152.954	1154.472	1.518	Maybe it goes somewhere along the top?		
45	48	1156.848	1157.739	0.891			
45	48	1157.64	1158.267	0.627	Good		
45	48	1162.392	1165.923	3.531		Alright, this... not a edge	
45	48	1167.309	1168.794	1.485		### goes along here	
45	48	1169.157	1169.817	0.66		No	
45	48	1170.642	1172.16	1.518	It's not an edge? Oh, okay		
45	48	1176.219	1177.407	1.188		Here's the-	
45	48	1178.397	1179.816	1.419	Here's one that might be an edge		
45	48	1181.202	1182.06	0.858		Yes	
45	48	1181.334	1183.083	1.749	Oh and you found another edge, that's good		
45	48	1184.073	1186.383	2.31		This is littler ###	
45	48	1187.604	1189.056	1.452		### go here	
45	48	1191.069	1195.128	4.059	Aah, I don't think that quite fits. Do you see how there's that other color there?		
45	48	1196.085	1198.098	2.013	Try this- Try this over here		
45	48	1199.352	1200.078	0.726		###	
45	48	1201.761	1202.553	0.792		Alright

45	48	1205.094	1205.853	0.759	Oh good		
45	48	1206.381	1207.206	0.825	There you go		
45	48	1206.513	1207.338	0.825			
45	48	1210.077	1212.354	2.277		Someone poured some red	
45	48	1212.453	1213.245	0.792	Yeah		
45	48	1214.169	1216.413	2.244	Do you see any more of that bright pinky-red?		
45	48	1218.294	1218.855	0.561		Here	
45	48	1218.822	1219.548	0.726	Yeah		
45	48	1220.472	1223.574	3.102		So, no it doesn't go there	
45	48	1229.085	1229.91	0.825			
45	48	1229.613	1230.438	0.825	That's good		
45	48	1231.065	1232.286	1.221		It goes there ###	
45	48	1234.365	1239.117	4.752		*noises* Here's some more of that red-pink	
45	48	1238.754	1241.229	2.475	Yeah, but that looks like a different plant now, doesn't it?		
45	48	1242.153	1244.925	2.772		Yeah, and, I'm not sure where that-	
45	48	1245.684	1247.301	1.617		Are we having a missing piece?	
45	48	1248.258	1249.974	1.716		Do you have any on your seat?	
45	48	1250.931	1251.921	0.99	Mmm nope		
45	48	1252.383	1253.175	0.792		###	
45	48	1253.175	1254.33	1.155	What are you looking for?		
45	48	1254.495	1257.663	3.168		We're looking for more of those right here	
45	48	1255.518	1262.151	6.633	That one? Keep looking here, there might be a little bit more of that pinky-red, and with a little bit of our leopard in it		
45	48	1263.174	1265.946	2.772	So it looks like we have a little bit of leopard ear to finish		
45	48	1268.256	1273.437	5.181		Alright, well, the leopard ear is what we're looking for	
45	48	1275.252	1277.232	1.98		I think we're missing a piece	
45	48	1279.41	1280.961	1.551	You know what I- I think I see it		
45	48	1279.74	1280.4	0.66		###

45	48	1290.465	1292.313	1.848	Do you know what? Now that I think about it, we're-		
45	48	1293.699	1298.814	5.115	Does it fit? Good. Aah, I don't think we finished the other leopard ear completely		
45	48	1300.233	1301.025	0.792		Yeah	
45	48	1303.17	1303.797	0.627		Mmm

45	48	1318.845	1327.425	8.58		*noises* Darker red, like the red ant. Does this one look like the same red as ###	
45	48	1327.854	1331.484	3.63	The red and looks a little different, what if we worked on the mushrooms?		
45	48	1330.791	1332.441	1.65		*noises* Yeah	
45	48	1335.411	1336.269	0.858

45	48	1345.938	1349.172	3.234		Red	
45	48	1349.931	1351.449	1.518	Should we work on the ant?		
45	48	1351.977	1353.825	1.848		Yeah	
45	48	1352.802	1355.343	2.541	I think we might have figured out that- where the ant goes		
45	48	1357.851	1362.009	4.158		Found this. Found that. No, that doesn't go there	
45	48	1366.893	1367.124	0.231

47	48	855.624	856.548	0.924	Mmm		
47	48	858.066	858.99	0.924	I don't think so		
47	48	859.914	860.805	0.891	What about right there?		
47	48	860.937	861.531	0.594		No-	
47	48	867.174	869.484	2.31		Because that's where the leopard goes

47	48	873.213	874.368	1.155	Does that fit?		
47	48	874.83	875.721	0.891		Mm-hmm	
47	48	875.655	878.724	3.069	Is that where the butterfly ends? See how it goes?		
47	48	879.318	880.11	0.792	But watch		
47	48	883.872	887.106	3.234	### get that one back in there. Now is that the butterfly?

47	48	912.054	912.615	0.561		What?	
47	48	914.859	916.542	1.683	Nothing. Do you think that's where it goes?		
47	48	922.812	923.571	0.759			
47	48	925.98	927.3	1.32		Where does this piece go?	
47	48	926.343	927.3	0.957			
47	48	929.841	932.778	2.937		I don't wanna do this puzzle anymore	
47	48	932.58	933.603	1.023	*laughing* Why?		
47	48	933.966	934.956	0.99		I just don't

47	48	941.886	942.942	1.056			
47	48	944.46	948.09	3.63	Try that one. Oh, good. Remember the edge has to go against the side		
47	48	949.806	950.796	0.99	That- Yeah		
47	48	952.479	953.172	0.693	Good job		
47	48	952.677	953.601	0.924			
47	48	956.406	957.561	1.155		Where does this go?	
47	48	958.683	961.29	2.607	Aah, it's an edge, so it doesn't go in the middle. See that?		
47	48	962.214	964.623	2.409	So it has to go across the end somewhere		
47	48	965.943	966.768	0.825	Does it fit there?		
47	48	969.87	970.893	1.023			
47	48	970.662	971.487	0.825	There you go		
47	48	973.104	974.391	1.287		Where does this go?	
47	48	977.724	978.78	1.056	I don't know where it goes		
47	48	980.1	981.684	1.584	I don't think it fits there though, does it?		
47	48	983.367	984.621	1.254		How 'bout here?	
47	48	984.753	985.512	0.759	Mmm, try it

47	48	991.419	994.059	2.64	These go together, I don't know where they go yet, though. Maybe here?		
47	48	995.379	996.237	0.858		Let's see	
47	48	995.412	998.448	3.036	'Cause there's a little bit of pink, right? Isn't there a little pink?		
47	48	998.877	999.702	0.825			
47	48	1001.451	1002.045	0.594	Good job

47	48	1024.419	1025.475	1.056	I don't think that's right		
47	48	1027.983	1028.841	0.858	What about this one?		
47	48	1035.606	1036.464	0.858			
47	48	1035.771	1036.761	0.99	Did we get it?		
47	48	1037.916	1039.005	1.089		Got it	
47	48	1038.345	1041.678	3.333	So we- So we need a piece here, and then we need these pieces		
47	48	1042.833	1043.295	0.462	Right?		
47	48	1043.031	1044.549	1.518		Don't forget ###

47	48	1060.026	1068.771	8.745	I don't know yet, so just leave it there, okay? Does it go there? 'Cause it doesn't fit. Does it go there? No, but we know it goes at the edge so just leave it there		
47	48	1060.686	1061.313	0.627		###	
47	48	1069.497	1070.685	1.188	How 'bout this one? Do we know?

47	48	1085.106	1086.558	1.452	Oops, I'll get it		
47	48	1088.736	1091.706	2.97		These ones even smaller!	
47	48	1092.762	1095.633	2.871		Do they just get smaller and smaller and smaller?	
47	48	1095.831	1096.887	1.056	I don't know. Here		
47	48	1096.326	1099.659	3.333		### we just- There's two treasure boxes

49	24	1191.036	1192.653	1.617		That's not a octopus!	
49	24	1192.785	1195.062	2.277	It is a octopus, see he has tentacles		
49	24	1193.214	1194.138	0.924			
49	24	1197.042	1201.563	4.521	With the little squishy spongy thingies, it's either a octopus or a squid		
49	24	1198.461	1199.583	1.122			
49	24	1203.873	1204.137	0.264

49	24	1210.737	1212.288	1.551	Yeah, that goes on the side		
49	24	1212.684	1215.093	2.409		And this- That's a octopus	
49	24	1213.905	1214.928	1.023			
49	24	1216.314	1216.908	0.594	###		
49	24	1217.238	1219.053	1.815		That's a octopus, Mommy	
49	24	1219.119	1220.736	1.617	How many legs does he have?		
49	24	1221.99	1223.145	1.155			
49	24	1222.287	1222.881	0.594		Okay	
49	24	1223.508	1228.557	5.049		One, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight	
49	24	1228.854	1230.801	1.947	So that makes this one a squid		
49	24	1231.956	1232.814	0.858		Wait	
49	24	1233.441	1234.893	1.452	No, it goes in the middle somewhere		
49	24	1236.642	1237.104	0.462	Nope		
49	24	1238.787	1241.328	2.541	My turn. Oh, here is his eye		
49	24	1243.011	1244.232	1.221		What? No	
49	24	1243.077	1243.671	0.594	###		
49	24	1244.463	1245.057	0.594	Yep		
49	24	1245.354	1246.377	1.023			
49	24	1246.344	1247.037	0.693	Next		
49	24	1248.654	1249.842	1.188	I'm out of pieces		
49	24	1257.762	1258.521	0.759		My turn	
49	24	1258.191	1259.148	0.957			
49	24	1259.379	1260.039	0.66	Mmm		
49	24	1260.435	1262.679	2.244		I pick this one, goes here	
49	24	1261.524	1262.679	1.155			
49	24	1263.108	1263.9	0.792	Your turn		
49	24	1264.362	1265.187	0.825		You see?	
49	24	1266.078	1268.487	2.409		That's just stuff of this part	
49	24	1268.718	1271.886	3.168	Oh! It's barnacles on a whale		
49	24	1272.513	1273.239	0.726		Yeah	
49	24	1273.14	1274.757	1.617	I got it, alright, next		
49	24	1277.496	1278.519	1.023			
49	24	1281.819	1282.842	1.023			
49	24	1282.248	1282.545	0.297			24 Piece - End
50	48	5.841	6.072	0.231			48 Piece - Start
50	48	6.27	7.755	1.485	Alright, how do we do this first?		
50	48	7.656	9.273	1.617		You have to get it out	
50	48	9.306	10.098	0.792	How do we get it out?		
50	48	11.088	11.484	0.396			Researcher Out
50	48	11.418	12.771	1.353		You just flip it over	
50	48	13.035	14.355	1.32	Mmkay, let's do that		
50	48	17.622	18.513	0.891		I told you	
50	48	18.579	20.592	2.013	Yep. Alright, we gonna mix 'em up?		
50	48	23.727	25.806	2.079		This one's a tricky- Whoa!	
50	48	25.08	26.367	1.287	It looks tricky		
50	48	26.829	30.294	3.465		### where this goes ###	
50	48	29.964	34.056	4.092	Looks new, too, 'cause their ones at the library would just come apart real easily, right?		
50	48	37.587	40.788	3.201		But this one's hard, ###	
50	48	41.151	42.834	1.683	Mmkay. Now what do we do first?		
50	48	43.23	44.55	1.32		I want this one	
50	48	45.111	46.728	1.617	Okay, that's a middle piece, right?		
50	48	47.157	47.85	0.693		So-	
50	48	47.388	48.84	1.452	So, what should we do first?		
50	48	50.193	51.744	1.551		We should do this one	
50	48	52.569	53.79	1.221		We should do this one	
50	48	53.691	59.367	5.676	How 'bout we try to find the corners first? That's a good one, that's an edge. and then we'll do edges next		
50	48	56.331	56.958	0.627		###	
50	48	58.773	59.829	1.056		It goes here	
50	48	59.829	62.634	2.805	Does it? I don't remember where it goes, but let's get the corners		
50	48	62.238	63.261	1.023		Aah, here	
50	48	64.713	67.089	2.376	Well, this has a flat side, right?		
50	48	65.868	66.132	0.264			
50	48	67.287	68.673	1.386		So it goes on the bottom?	
50	48	69.201	73.656	4.455	It goes somewhere along the edge. So let's find the corners, can we find the corners?		
50	48	72.501	72.996	0.495		*gasp*	
50	48	77.55	78.408	0.858		Mmm	
50	48	78.705	80.52	1.815	Do you see any corner- Is that a corner piece?		
50	48	85.107	86.427	1.32	Do those go together that way?		
50	48	87.153	89.958	2.805	I don't think that that matches. Do you think that matches?		
50	48	93.489	96.591	3.102	Well that's not a corner. But I think you're right that they go together		
50	48	97.449	100.419	2.97		But this one goes together with that one	
50	48	101.508	103.521	2.013	Is that an edge piece? Oh good job		
50	48	104.28	106.623	2.343		Goes on botto- It goes like that	
50	48	105.468	107.382	1.914	so we have to figure out which way is up		
50	48	110.22	111.474	1.254		This one's up	
50	48	111.078	115.335	4.257	Okay, let's find the corners. Do you see any other corners? There should be four corners, right?		
50	48	115.698	116.886	1.188	Oh that's a good edge		
50	48	118.602	119.757	1.155	Ooh, nice!		
50	48	118.602	120.318	1.716		Oh look! *laughing*	
50	48	122.331	124.08	1.749		###	
50	48	126.159	127.116	0.957		Look at this	
50	48	127.182	129.789	2.607	Well this has a flat side, right? So where does that go?		
50	48	133.485	134.145	0.66		Aah	
50	48	134.541	136.158	1.617	Nice. Is it sticky?		
50	48	136.62	137.346	0.726	There it goes		
50	48	139.029	140.613	1.584		Where does this go?	
50	48	140.613	146.652	6.039	I don't know. He's a middle piece though, so why don't we get the edges and the corners first, and then we'll try to figure out which way this goes		
50	48	141.933	142.527	0.594		###	
50	48	146.454	147.081	0.627		Ooh	
50	48	147.906	149.028	1.122		*laughing*	
50	48	149.952	151.701	1.749	Well that's part of this guy, isn't it?		
50	48	155.1	161.766	6.666		*laughing* Yeah. I found ### the eye. There's an eye	
50	48	158.796	161.172	2.376	Okay let's- Let's finish the edges though, b-		
50	48	161.931	164.274	2.343	Let's finish the edges. Did you find any more corners?		
50	48	164.703	165.825	1.122	I don't see any more corners		
50	48	165.924	168.333	2.409		Oh! This one doesn't have an edge	
50	48	168.399	170.313	1.914	That one doesn't have an edge. This one has an edge		
50	48	170.247	171.765	1.518		Oh yeah. where does this go?	
50	48	171.534	172.623	1.089	I don't know		
50	48	172.557	174.207	1.65		*laughing* Oh I know where that goes	
50	48	174.273	175.065	0.792	You do?		
50	48	176.22	177.177	0.957		I almost got it	
50	48	178.002	179.025	1.023		###	
50	48	180.279	181.533	1.254	Does it go over here?		
50	48	182.094	183.084	0.99		I think it goes-	
50	48	182.523	183.48	0.957	Did you try it?		
50	48	184.008	184.899	0.891		I think it goes here	
50	48	185.889	186.153	0.264			
50	48	186.78	187.77	0.99	Oh good job		
50	48	188.628	189.948	1.32		It goes on bottom!	
50	48	190.113	192.654	2.541	Nice. I think this is part of the toucan		
50	48	190.641	191.433	0.792		### does that	
50	48	193.116	194.931	1.815		There's a toucan in there?	
50	48	194.568	198.198	3.63	Yeah, we might have s- We might have mixed this up, but okay let's keep looking		
50	48	198.033	199.782	1.749		We didn't mix that up	
50	48	200.673	207.537	6.864	Let's look for the corners. We need three more corners. 'Member a corner piece, it has this edge on two sides		
50	48	209.022	209.781	0.759	Do you see any?		
50	48	210.408	211.167	0.759		*gasp*	
50	48	211.992	213.048	1.056	Oh there's one		
50	48	213.84	214.632	0.792		But that one-	
50	48	213.873	215.292	1.419	We'll have to figure out where it goes		
50	48	215.952	216.975	1.023	Do you think it goes over there?		
50	48	216.414	217.14	0.726			
50	48	217.569	218.328	0.759		I think so	
50	48	218.13	220.605	2.475	Okay. What about other corner pieces?		
50	48	218.856	219.549	0.693		###	
50	48	221.727	222.816	1.089		This one has a corner	
50	48	222.849	223.575	0.726	Yeah?		
50	48	224.763	226.479	1.716	Do those go togeth- That's an edge, right?		
50	48	227.7	228.888	1.188		So it goes there	
50	48	227.931	228.756	0.825			
50	48	229.053	229.647	0.594	Nice		
50	48	231.033	232.122	1.089	Pretty orchids		
50	48	232.617	234.3	1.683		Pretty orchids ###	
50	48	234.234	235.818	1.584	Yeah. Alright, what else?		
50	48	238.491	240.603	2.112	That's a middle piece, so let's wait on that one		
50	48	240.372	241.263	0.891		*laughing* Yeah	
50	48	241.296	242.418	1.122	Do you see any other-		
50	48	243.804	244.695	0.891	Oh who's this guy?		
50	48	245.025	246.18	1.155		He's a koala	
50	48	246.246	247.368	1.122	I think he's a sloth		
50	48	247.665	249.777	2.112		### sloth, well it's koala	
50	48	249.876	250.47	0.594	###		
50	48	250.107	251.46	1.353		### koala sloth	
50	48	250.965	251.856	0.891	You think it's a koala?		
50	48	252.153	253.341	1.188		It's a koala sloth	
50	48	253.176	254.364	1.188	*laughing* a koala sloth?		
50	48	254.166	261.261	7.095		Yeah, koalas- This one is a koala sloth, so it has- it has a little gray and a little green	
50	48	261.36	262.515	1.155	Oh		
50	48	262.152	264.363	2.211		Look, this is a part of his hand	
50	48	264.957	267.861	2.904	Where's the other corner pieces? We need two more corner pieces		
50	48	269.379	270.567	1.188	Oh you got that together?		
50	48	271.656	272.844	1.188	Aah		
50	48	277.167	279.972	2.805	Mmm, I don't think it goes like that		
50	48	280.599	281.457	0.858	Does it go on the bottom?		
50	48	287.859	289.806	1.947	Hmm, is this an edge?		
50	48	289.245	292.05	2.805		*gasp* That's his feet ###	
50	48	291.225	293.106	1.881	Is this- I think this goes up at the top		
50	48	295.68	296.67	0.99	Try it right there		
50	48	303.732	304.92	1.188	We got it. Good job		
50	48	305.91	306.141	0.231			
50	48	306.174	306.801	0.627	Okay		
50	48	307.56	308.451	0.891		###	
50	48	307.626	308.715	1.089	Is there another edge?		
50	48	309.375	310.167	0.792	Another corner?		
50	48	313.368	314.853	1.485	Oh there's a corner		
50	48	316.14	318.582	2.442	Hmm. You think it goes there?		
50	48	316.239	317.295	1.056		### here	
50	48	319.275	321.42	2.145		I think that's where the cheetah goes	
50	48	320.001	320.925	0.924	Hmm		
50	48	321.519	322.212	0.693	Might be		
50	48	323.103	324.126	1.023	Where does this piece go?		
50	48	325.215	325.941	0.726		I don't know	
50	48	325.809	326.964	1.155	Where's the red stuff?		
50	48	329.472	333.069	3.597	Mmm, this is an edge though, so maybe, does this go along the edge?		
50	48	335.247	336.336	1.089		Does it go like this?	
50	48	336.864	337.887	1.023	Maybe		
50	48	338.613	340.956	2.343	Now where does it go? Along the edge?		
50	48	346.896	347.655	0.759	Nice!		
50	48	350.46	353.034	2.574		Then where does-	
50	48	352.44	353.925	1.485	Are there any other corners?		
50	48	358.083	360.063	1.98		*gasp* I think this goes	
50	48	360.162	361.581	1.419	I think it might		
50	48	365.409	365.937	0.528	Flip		
50	48	368.907	369.666	0.759		*gasp*	
50	48	369.831	370.722	0.891	Nice one		
50	48	370.293	372.108	1.815		Did it, we did it	
50	48	372.141	373.065	0.924	We did it		
50	48	374.319	375.738	1.419		*gasp* toucan	
50	48	374.748	377.685	2.937	I'm wondering if we mixed this up though		
50	48	377.421	378.18	0.759		Toucan	
50	48	378.675	379.731	1.056	Is that part of the toucan?		
50	48	382.008	382.833	0.825	Flip it maybe?		
50	48	385.341	386.298	0.957	Keep trying		
50	48	390.489	391.215	0.726	Nice		
50	48	393.525	396.627	3.102	Oh you know what? I think that goes up here

50	48	435.138	435.732	0.594		No	
50	48	439.89	443.817	3.927	Hmm, put him- Put those two back together. Are there any other sloth pieces?		
50	48	444.84	447.315	2.475		He needs his feet *gasp*	
50	48	446.952	448.074	1.122

50	48	450.45	454.179	3.729	Ooh, okay. Where do you think that goes?		
50	48	456.291	458.568	2.277		He goes up here. See I told you	
50	48	458.634	459.591	0.957	Can you put it in?		
50	48	461.736	463.386	1.65	Fit one side, and then the other

50	48	464.211	464.904	0.693	Nice!		
50	48	464.838	466.587	1.749		See, I told you he can fit on there	
50	48	466.653	470.514	3.861	You're right. And then is there a piece that goes here, to link these two together?		
50	48	469.326	469.887	0.561		Oh	
50	48	471.273	472.098	0.825	What do you think?		
50	48	473.352	474.969	1.617		### I can't find it

50	48	479.853	480.81	0.957		Feet	
50	48	481.206	484.341	3.135	This is a butterfly. Maybe the butterfly goes over here		
50	48	485.991	486.948	0.957	What do you think?		
50	48	486.387	487.245	0.858		Feet

50	48	493.02	495.396	2.376	Yeah, but I haven't seen where he goes, have you?		
50	48	497.178	498.993	1.815		There's no edges on there	
50	48	499.29	500.346	1.056	Hmm		
50	48	500.478	501.534	1.056		This one has an edge	
50	48	502.623	503.679	1.056	Is that part of the butterfly?		
50	48	505.725	506.616	0.891	Nope		
50	48	507.144	507.936	0.792		###	
50	48	507.507	508.266	0.759	Do those match?		
50	48	508.86	510.444	1.584		### this one	
50	48	509.289	511.962	2.673	Try- Wait, try the other side. Try the other side		
50	48	512.787	514.47	1.683	Well I don't- did that match?		
50	48	515.79	516.945	1.155		Oh, this one-

50	48	521.4	522.39	0.99		Flip it over	
50	48	523.215	524.106	0.891		Flip it over	
50	48	525.063	526.944	1.881		Actually ### pieces ###

50	48	529.089	529.65	0.561	Better?		
50	48	532.851	534.27	1.419		Think this goes like-	
50	48	536.811	537.735	0.924	Nice!		
50	48	540.474	541.893	1.419	That's another edge		
50	48	543.048	544.269	1.221	Hmm		
50	48	545.193	548.691	3.498		There's no s- *gasp* Spots!	
50	48	545.853	546.117	0.264			
50	48	546.051	547.371	1.32	Does it go d- at the bottom?		
50	48	553.047	554.07	1.023	Did you find something?		
50	48	555.225	556.578	1.353		Spots	
50	48	555.423	556.644	1.221	Mmm		
50	48	558.294	559.383	1.089		Spots!	
50	48	559.152	560.043	0.891	I see that		
50	48	561.792	562.782	0.99		What is the-	
50	48	561.792	564.564	2.772	What i- Are there other butterfly pieces that you see anywhere?		
50	48	567.897	568.557	0.66		*gasp*	
50	48	569.745	570.306	0.561	This one?		
50	48	570.636	571.527	0.891		That	
50	48	570.933	571.956	1.023	Where do you think this one goes?		
50	48	572.847	574.332	1.485		I think this one goes-	
50	48	577.599	580.008	2.409	Mmm, nope. Doesn't match		
50	48	581.427	582.582	1.155		Does it match here?	
50	48	582.879	585.189	2.31	I don't know. *gasp* I think it does		
50	48	585.618	587.301	1.683	What about, any other butterfly pieces?		
50	48	591.03	595.452	4.422	That's an inside piece, so we'll have to wait and see. That might go like around here somewhere		
50	48	596.046	597.531	1.485		*gasp* I know where that goes	
50	48	597.366	599.313	1.947	This doesn't have an edge though, right?		
50	48	599.643	600.468	0.825	Does it have a edge?		
50	48	599.643	600.996	1.353		*sigh* No	
50	48	600.831	602.052	1.221	Okay we can hold on		
50	48	602.613	604.164	1.551	Do you see any other butterfly pieces?		
50	48	605.286	606.507	1.221	Oh that's an edge		
50	48	607.332	608.091	0.759	That's an edge piece		
50	48	608.916	612.513	3.597		But it doesn't fit. *gasp* I know where that goes	
50	48	612.48	616.572	4.092	Okay. What about other butterfly pieces? Let's look for the blue butterfly pieces		
50	48	619.938	621.06	1.122	that's an inside piece		
50	48	624.723	625.482	0.759	Turn it		
50	48	632.94	636.042	3.102		Aah. That goes inside there!	
50	48	635.778	637.989	2.211	Good, now where was that other inside piece you had?		
50	48	639.375	640.299	0.924	Hmm		
50	48	642.675	644.358	1.683	Hmm, maybe turn it?		
50	48	646.041	650.199	4.158	No, not yet. This looks like someone's nose		
50	48	651.222	655.017	3.795		*laughing* Yeah, I think so. *gasp* Wait	
50	48	661.518	662.508	0.99	Huh		
50	48	662.706	665.643	2.937		Someone's nose *gasp*	
50	48	665.181	667.854	2.673	Is there other pieces of his nose, or his mouth?		
50	48	668.778	672.408	3.63		That goes like- I think some of 'em can just ###	
50	48	672.276	673.2	0.924	Okay		
50	48	673.431	678.282	4.851		Let's do this crocodile	
50	48	678.579	679.206	0.627		*laughing*	
50	48	679.206	680.394	1.188	A crocodile?		
50	48	680.46	681.879	1.419		Yeah I know. Crocodile	
50	48	686.466	687.522	1.056		See, I told ya

50	48	692.472	694.782	2.31		Actually it doesn't have an edge	
50	48	694.683	699.171	4.488	Yeah. that's an inside piece, so we put that like right here, 'cause it somewhere in here maybe?		
50	48	695.739	696.531	0.792		###	
50	48	699.336	703.395	4.059		Oh, I think it goes right there	
50	48	704.187	705.474	1.287	Does it go- No		
50	48	705.408	708.378	2.97		*gasp* I think there's- There's a little green	
50	48	708.279	710.292	2.013	Yeah, but I don't know that it matches up		
50	48	711.48	713.889	2.409	Maybe, move it over, maybe over here?		
50	48	715.308	716.265	0.957	Is that like it?		
50	48	716.199	717.189	0.99			
50	48	718.476	719.664	1.188	Oh I think you're right

50	48	724.68	726.561	1.881		Oh! Can't!	
50	48	726.759	729.531	2.772	Just slow down. These aren't- This is a new puzzle		
50	48	728.706	729.63	0.924			
50	48	730.455	732.6	2.145		### you know this doesn't go there	
50	48	732.666	735.57	2.904	Yeah, I don't know- I wonder if we have this the right way		
50	48	733.722	734.646	0.924		It doesn't	
50	48	736.89	737.781	0.891	Hmm

50	48	751.146	752.235	1.089	Goes up here		
50	48	756.393	757.614	1.221		And where does this go?	
50	48	758.208	759.264	1.056		### see this

50	48	764.709	765.567	0.858	It isn't?		
50	48	766.359	768.372	2.013		Wait, you're right. It does	
50	48	768.768	770.22	1.452	Maybe this goes-

50	48	784.146	785.433	1.287			
50	48	785.862	786.159	0.297			
50	48	786.522	787.974	1.452	Maybe the butterfly goes down here		
50	48	788.37	790.35	1.98		The butterfly doesn't go down there	
50	48	790.449	793.089	2.64	I think he goes down here. Let's try him- Let's try it!		
50	48	791.241	792.198	0.957		No! He-

51	24	49.137	50.622	1.485	Yeah, so-		
51	24	51.843	57.519	5.676	Let's to the puzzle. We can do it- I don't think we need to do it on here. We can just do it on here. That way we can look at this as a guide, okay?		
51	24	58.674	60.753	2.079		I think it's gonna get covered up	
51	24	59.895	60.126	0.231			
51	24	61.05	62.535	1.485	No, we're ### on the table		
51	24	64.086	66.231	2.145	And so try to find all of the pieces		
51	24	64.482	66.825	2.343		Oh!	
51	24	70.125	70.752	0.627	Okay		
51	24	71.115	71.907	0.792		Mmm	
51	24	76.923	77.682	0.759	*Mm-hmm*		
51	24	82.236	83.589	1.353	Good, that goes together		
51	24	84.546	85.206	0.66	Good		
51	24	86.295	87.252	0.957		Mmm	
51	24	86.361	87.879	1.518	I think that's up at the top, right?		
51	24	88.968	92.598	3.63	See the straight edge? So that's gonna go up at the top. Does that connect right there?		
51	24	97.911	98.538	0.627	Mmkay		
51	24	102.399	103.587	1.188	### the others		
51	24	112.761	113.454	0.693	Good		
51	24	120.648	124.575	3.927	You can probably try to find the seahorse body. That'd probably be easy		
51	24	128.337	128.832	0.495		###	
51	24	128.931	129.789	0.858	Mm-hmm		
51	24	130.713	131.637	0.924	And what else?		
51	24	136.323	137.775	1.452		We need to find the face	
51	24	137.775	138.534	0.759	Mm-hmm		
51	24	140.382	142.263	1.881	Or you can see what else might go with that purple piece		
51	24	144.177	145.101	0.924	That doesn't go there		
51	24	157.344	158.829	1.485	What color is the face, do you think?		
51	24	161.799	162.789	0.99	Oh that's good		
51	24	166.98	168.993	2.013		I don't think this is a type of animal	
51	24	169.554	170.445	0.891	That's not an animal		
51	24	171.105	173.184	2.079	What color face do you think that has?		
51	24	173.448	174.471	1.023		I don't know	
51	24	175.23	176.154	0.924	Blue?		
51	24	176.715	178.2	1.485	Look at the umm, example		
51	24	178.86	180.378	1.518		Yeah	
51	24	179.85	180.147	0.297			
51	24	179.916	181.467	1.551	So you have to find a blue piece		
51	24	186.45	187.803	1.353		This is too small	
51	24	187.869	188.694	0.825	Mm-hmm		
51	24	190.179	196.086	5.907	But look, see how this edge is straight? ### Straight end- straight edge for there. But you can see if it fits up here somewhere		
51	24	192.258	192.984	0.726		Mm-hmm	
51	24	197.538	199.485	1.947		*noises*	
51	24	202.059	202.686	0.627	Good		
51	24	211.53	214.632	3.102		Mmm, mom I can't find what goes there	
51	24	215.094	216.018	0.924	###		
51	24	220.11	221.727	1.617	You need something that has a straight edge		
51	24	227.205	230.934	3.729	You wanna try to connect the orange? Maybe put the orange parts together		
51	24	237.963	238.788	0.825	That's good		
51	24	243.111	245.091	1.98		The bottom of the shark	
51	24	246.015	251.361	5.346	Is it? Or it looks like an octopus. Or is that the shark? What is that? I don't know what that is		
51	24	251.724	253.605	1.881	*yeah, don't put that on your head, silly girl*		
51	24	255.981	256.839	0.858	Let's see		
51	24	264.132	267.729	3.597	Hmm, I see this eye Look. Does that go there?		
51	24	272.811	273.702	0.891		Mmm	
51	24	273.801	274.725	0.924	Mm-hmm		
51	24	286.506	288.453	1.947	Good. That's a shark		
51	24	299.871	300.135	0.264			
51	24	302.709	303.798	1.089		What's that go in?	
51	24	304.524	306.504	1.98	Mmm, I don't think that goes there		
51	24	309.045	310.035	0.99		The ###	
51	24	309.738	311.685	1.947	Mm-hmm, where do you think this big orange piece goes?		
51	24	312.246	312.873	0.627		Mmm	
51	24	316.008	319.044	3.036	Aah, that looks good. What is that, octopus		
51	24	319.902	320.727	0.825	Or a squid		
51	24	321.057	322.113	1.056		That's the squid	
51	24	321.387	322.509	1.122	What is that, a squid?		
51	24	324.423	326.601	2.178		I don't think we have a octopus	
51	24	326.337	328.944	2.607	Actually, I think it is an octopus, 'cause it has eight legs		
51	24	330.594	331.221	0.627	Yeah		
51	24	352.605	354.717	2.112		How do you know we can do it on the table?	
51	24	355.575	360.525	4.95	Umm, because you can do puzzles on the table. And I wanted us to see the example, it makes it easier		
51	24	378.345	380.127	1.782		This doesn't look right	
51	24	379.632	380.457	0.825	Mm-mm		
51	24	381.975	383.262	1.287		What goes here?	
51	24	383.163	384.78	1.617	Oh, this might be the other piece, sorry		
51	24	392.931	393.591	0.66	Good		
51	24	400.653	401.247	0.594	Good

51	24	412.599	415.965	3.366	Let's move this out of the way, because ### connect the puzzles		
51	24	416.691	417.417	0.726	Okay		
51	24	427.317	428.769	1.452	*It fell down? You can put it back up*		
51	24	438.339	441.936	3.597	Here, put this closer to you, too, 'cause there's some at the top too

51	48	155.661	159.489	3.828	Maybe, scoot it- See how it's a straight edge? Line it up with the other straight edges		
51	48	162.789	164.142	1.353	See? That makes the border		
51	48	172.359	175.857	3.498	Okay. Look at the color, you see how it's pink there, and that's pink?		
51	48	176.385	179.19	2.805	That's part of his nose, so you can connect that, see?

51	48	224.994	230.967	5.973	And see look, this is brown, and that's green, I don't think that's supposed to go there. We'll have to hold on, hold on to that

51	48	328.647	329.241	0.594		*laughing*	
51	48	329.868	330.33	0.462	Good		
51	48	330.99	334.917	3.927	There's a piece of the jaguar. I don't know where that one goes, though. It's just a little spot		
51	48	341.451	342.144	0.693	Hmm		
51	48	343.959	346.467	2.508	Try it right here, there's like, room for a spot maybe?		
51	48	348.843	349.536	0.693	Yeah		
51	48	350.79	352.011	1.221	It's a beautiful jaguar		
51	48	352.44	354.915	2.475	Or cheetah? It's a jaguar or cheetah, it's either-		
51	48	355.08	356.499	1.419		I think it's a cheetah	
51	48	357.72	359.997	2.277		Because jaguars have stripes	
51	48	360.228	364.848	4.62	Jaguar- no. Jaguars have spots. Baby jaguar Diego has spots		
51	48	370.029	370.788	0.759	Mmkay		
51	48	379.863	380.589	0.726	*It's a flower*		
51	48	381.282	382.932	1.65	So, what are you gonna put together now?		
51	48	389.037	390.093	1.056	Oh, that's his ear?		
51	48	391.941	394.515	2.574	*Mmm, that's the snake's eye*		
51	48	396.66	399.102	2.442		I can't find out where it goes	
51	48	398.871	402.303	3.432	Let me see. Maybe try- Try the other ear, maybe it doesn't go on this ear		
51	48	404.811	405.273	0.462	See?		
51	48	412.731	413.49	0.759		###	
51	48	412.797	415.371	2.574	And that's another part of the jaguar, I mean the umm, yeah		
51	48	424.413	428.109	3.696	And you can probably try to connect some red stuff there if you want to		
51	48	431.145	431.706	0.561	Good eye		
51	48	448.932	451.077	2.145		That's not the one that goes there	
51	48	450.582	452.628	2.046	Yeah, ###		
51	48	453.156	454.179	1.023	*It's not scary*		
51	48	457.578	458.436	0.858		###	
51	48	458.271	458.931	0.66	Mm-hmm		
51	48	460.845	462.099	1.254	*It's not scary*		
51	48	463.419	465.993	2.574	*Because it's not* You want- Are you looking for more red flowers?		
51	48	467.214	468.732	1.518	### flowers there too		
51	48	473.121	475.101	1.98		I can't find out which one goes-	
51	48	476.322	477.477	1.155	### Does that one go ###		
51	48	480.612	482.493	1.881	*you wanna go? Where do you wanna go?*		
51	48	483.681	484.473	0.792		###	
51	48	484.605	485.991	1.386	Mmm, that doesn't go		
51	48	486.849	488.301	1.452	*I don't have any gum, *name**		
51	48	489.819	490.743	0.924	Did you try this one?		
51	48	491.172	491.931	0.759		Yes	
51	48	492.228	494.472	2.244	Did you try it on the edge? 'Cause that's a straight edge		
51	48	499.488	500.148	0.66	*Okay*		
51	48	501.699	502.293	0.594	*here*		
51	48	502.953	504.57	1.617	*You play with the blocks, *name**		
51	48	507.474	508.728	1.254	*You wanna play with my phone?*		
51	48	509.982	512.325	2.343	*I don't have a granola bar. Do you wanna play with my phone?*		
51	48	513.579	514.404	0.825	*Do you wanna play with my phone?*		
51	48	515.559	517.176	1.617	*Okay, have a seat. Let me get it*		
51	48	519.684	522.159	2.475		### can't find out which one to go	
51	48	522.456	526.878	4.422	What about this one? Are you looking at the example? See how there's a frog on the red leaf?		
51	48	532.29	532.851	0.561		*laughing*	
51	48	533.049	533.61	0.561	See?		
51	48	533.841	536.25	2.409	And then you can try to find more red that connects that one		
51	48	543.873	544.137	0.264			
51	48	552.519	556.743	4.224	Look at that flower, I think that flower goes at the bottom, ### it's a little bit different. See how it's different?		
51	48	555.786	556.413	0.627		###	
51	48	559.053	561.561	2.508	I bet you can- Will it connect down here		
51	48	565.719	566.973	1.254		It won't connect there	
51	48	566.907	568.755	1.848	Yeah, 'cause it's in the corner, over here		
51	48	569.844	571.23	1.386	We don't have those pieces yet		
51	48	584.529	586.245	1.716		Look this one has a berry	
51	48	585.717	590.238	4.521	Mm-hmm. That's part of the, umm, toucan. So that goes at the top up here somewhere		
51	48	586.674	587.268	0.594		That's-	
51	48	599.445	602.481	3.036		Mommy, can't find the one that goes here	
51	48	602.316	603.108	0.792	Let's see		
51	48	603.339	604.131	0.792		Mmm	
51	48	604.428	607.2	2.772	Umm, is this one?		
51	48	607.959	609.015	1.056	See if that one goes there		
51	48	611.556	612.018	0.462	Yep		
51	48	613.569	614.889	1.32		And then what goes here?	
51	48	614.526	617.265	2.739	So this- What does it look like? What's next?		
51	48	617.397	618.519	1.122		Snakey	
51	48	618.024	621.192	3.168	Yeah, so find part of the snake body. Right there's the snake		
51	48	621.984	623.106	1.122	Here's part of the snake		
51	48	628.485	631.455	2.97	And remember, if it's a straight edge, you match up the straight edges		
51	48	633.93	634.755	0.825	*Mm-hmm*		
51	48	635.877	636.537	0.66	*Yeah?*		
51	48	637.461	638.88	1.419	*Okay, can I have that piece back?*		
51	48	639.573	640.431	0.858	*I see*		
51	48	642.345	642.939	0.594	*Thank you*		
51	48	642.543	644.886	2.343		Mommy, I can't find it	
51	48	644.325	645.678	1.353	*Give me that puzzle piece, *name**		
51	48	650.43	650.991	0.561	Mmkay		
51	48	652.146	654.39	2.244		It's a straight edge but-	
51	48	653.796	657.921	4.125	Yeah, so, you match it up. Turn it around, the straight edges go together		
51	48	660.594	661.188	0.594	See?		
51	48	663.366	664.587	1.221	That looks like an eye		
51	48	665.313	666.798	1.485		This is not a straight edge	
51	48	666.798	667.26	0.462	No		
51	48	671.154	672.573	1.419	Good, you completed his eye		
51	48	674.223	675.279	1.056	You see more of the snake?		
51	48	675.84	676.764	0.924	Where's the snake head?		
51	48	680.262	680.823	0.561	Hmm		
51	48	685.773	686.466	0.693	Where is it? 		
51	48	686.928	688.479	1.551		Mmm, I don't know	
51	48	691.746	693.891	2.145	Okay, well let's do a different piece		
51	48	696.366	699.666	3.3	We're missing part of the baby jaguar. Or the jaguar- here		
51	48	699.6	701.382	1.782		Or the big jaguar	
51	48	700.359	702.207	1.848	This looks like it. You see the mushrooms?		
51	48	702.669	703.329	0.66		Mm-hmm	
51	48	703.065	704.814	1.749	And then part of his mouth there?		
51	48	706.563	708.576	2.013	And then what's next, these mushrooms		
51	48	709.929	710.985	1.056		Yes	
51	48	711.216	714.285	3.069	And so, maybe try to find some more mushrooms and ants?		
51	48	712.008	713.559	1.551		Mmm	
51	48	717.75	718.905	1.155	'Member? Straight edges		
51	48	720.687	722.271	1.584	Find some more mushrooms and ants		
51	48	730.521	732.864	2.343	See, that's not a straight edge, it doesn't fit ###		
51	48	746.922	749.595	2.673		Mommy, I don't know what ### goes here	
51	48	749.661	750.519	0.858	You see the green?		
51	48	750.552	751.179	0.627		Mmm	
51	48	751.08	754.644	3.564	Do you think, maybe it connects to this green right here, and that part of the mushroom		
51	48	752.334	753.621	1.287		Mmm, Mmm	
51	48	763.026	763.686	0.66		No	
51	48	764.082	764.775	0.693	Mm-mm		
51	48	766.26	768.9	2.64		I think that connects to this	
51	48	769.362	770.55	1.188	Maybe, try it and see		
51	48	776.457	777.711	1.254		No, look. Look	
51	48	776.589	778.734	2.145	Hmm, no I don't think so		
51	48	778.965	779.493	0.528		###	
51	48	779.757	782.925	3.168	Yeah, well it looks like this is another piece of the ant		
51	48	783.849	784.146	0.297			
51	48	786.885	788.238	1.353		It doesn't go here	
51	48	789.063	790.746	1.683		Look. Look!	
51	48	792.759	793.386	0.627	No		
51	48	796.092	798.6	2.508		This puzzle is too tricky!	
51	48	798.666	800.316	1.65	It's a little bit tricky, but you can do it		
51	48	801.141	803.121	1.98		'Cause I completed the butterfly	
51	48	803.187	805.2	2.013	Mm-hmm. And you did that really quickly		
51	48	814.11	814.803	0.693	###		
51	48	816.222	819.192	2.97	So, there- We've gotta be able to put this together. Look		
51	48	829.587	831.402	1.815		I need something	
51	48	833.085	835.857	2.772	You wanna try to connect the ants? And see if that connects there?		
51	48	838.695	840.345	1.65	And what does this look like?		
51	48	841.5	842.259	0.759		This	
51	48	842.754	846.681	3.927	Yeah, but that's at the bottom, so that probably won't fit, but there's some more red plants though, right?		
51	48	847.374	848.661	1.287		###	
51	48	849.948	851.301	1.353		Mommy, what's this?	
51	48	851.631	852.984	1.353	NAME, do you need to use the bathroom?

51	48	858.297	859.551	1.254		No, what is it for?	
51	48	859.617	861.102	1.485	I don't know. Come have a seat		
51	48	868.23	869.847	1.617		I need some more ones	
51	48	869.88	871.332	1.452	Mm-hmm. I put some right there		
51	48	876.447	877.272	0.825		Where?	
51	48	879.318	880.968	1.65		I can't find reds	
51	48	881.034	882.849	1.815	NAME this is red up here, see		
51	48	883.377	884.961	1.584	Like, see this'll connect, see?		
51	48	885.885	887.106	1.221	And then this ### connect		
51	48	887.733	889.218	1.485	See, all you gotta do is put 'em together		
51	48	897.105	899.613	2.508	There. And there might be another red piece here		
51	48	900.57	901.758	1.188	I found another red piece

52	48	402.28	409.83	7.55		A catrishion.  It's a scientist and catrishion for your bowl to eat food.	
52	48	409.855	411.375	1.52	Really? How about that goes there.		
52	48	411.415	412.745	1.33		It's a catrishion.

52	48	422.41	423.97	1.56	Why'd you put that there?		
52	48	424.09	426.95	2.86		An elephant is a catrishion.	
52	48	426.98	427.67	0.69	Mm-hmm.

52	48	437.66	438.66	1.0	I think so.		
52	48	439.36	442.77	3.41	Turn it.  You have to turn it until it fits.		
52	48	442.965	444.135	1.17	It's upside-down.  Turn it.

52	48	474.555	478.285	3.73	It has to make a picture when you put it back together. We have to put the picture back together.		
52	48	478.3	478.61	0.31		No.	
52	48	478.765	480.495	1.73	I think we can do that, right?

53	24	206.477	209.017	2.54	What about this next piece here?		
53	24	209.022	210.812	1.79		I think this one goes	
53	24	210.632	211.532	0.9	You think that one goes there?		
53	24	212.947	213.657	0.71	No		
53	24	213.477	213.997	0.52		No	
53	24	215.102	215.862	0.76	Maybe not		
53	24	215.897	216.747	0.85		Maybe this one	
53	24	217.377	217.977	0.6	try it		
53	24	220.142	221.132	0.99	You got it		
53	24	227.052	229.912	2.86		I think it could...could...	
53	24	229.937	232.587	2.65	I don't know. You think that's the same color as the octopus?		
53	24	234.877	235.497	0.62		### see?	
53	24	235.522	236.632	1.11		it's mouth

53	24	240.962	243.442	2.48	Maybe it is part of this other piece here		
53	24	243.587	244.707	1.12	Or this one		
53	24	244.702	245.542	0.84		yeah	
53	24	245.577	246.797	1.22	Why don't we put the colors together?		
53	24	246.782	247.192	0.41		yeah	
53	24	247.392	248.312	0.92	that one		
53	24	248.747	251.837	3.09		maybe..it could go...right here	
53	24	251.857	254.437	2.58	I don't know. It doesn't look like it fits into there		
53	24	254.612	258.112	3.5	Well maybe just leave it right there for now until we find where it goes		
53	24	258.147	258.687	0.54		here	
53	24	260.042	262.602	2.56	This one looks like the other piece of the, the octopus		
53	24	263.817	265.597	1.78		Well I can't find it	
53	24	265.742	268.332	2.59	Well maybe..hmm...are you sure?

53	24	274.677	275.967	1.29	alright. what else?		
53	24	275.957	277.517	1.56		This one could go to the other	
53	24	275.987	278.047	2.06	Well that one might, yeah. 		
53	24	278.082	279.732	1.65	One of your orange pieces		
53	24	279.752	282.182	2.43	That match with the crab. That looks like a crab doesn't it?		
53	24	283.742	284.672	0.93	Put the crab together		
53	24	286.642	287.332	0.69		I'm do

53	24	289.847	291.567	1.72	Doesn't it go together there?

53	24	303.287	305.157	1.87	What other edges ### your piece is missing		
53	24	308.167	312.027	3.86		Let's just keep working on the octopus and the other octopus	
53	24	308.602	309.712	1.11	Isn't this part of the crab?		
53	24	310.162	312.132	1.97	Alright, now you're looking for purple		
53	24	312.252	312.772	0.52	purple

53	24	321.057	324.227	3.17		Oh this one should go over here	
53	24	327.717	329.407	1.69		And this should go over here	
53	24	329.467	330.057	0.59	okay		
53	24	330.817	333.037	2.22		I think we should move all this over here	
53	24	333.072	334.812	1.74	Oh that's probably a good idea		
53	24	335.247	337.537	2.29	Alright. So we're missing what else now?		
53	24	337.917	339.817	1.9	We're missing a corner piece there		
53	24	339.982	340.762	0.78		right here?

53	24	358.372	360.972	2.6	Awesome. Those look like a bunch of arrows right?		
53	24	360.977	361.237	0.26		What?	
53	24	361.922	364.092	2.17	Arrows. They look like points. Arrows. 		
53	24	366.092	366.952	0.86	okay		
53	24	367.097	367.777	0.68		There we go

53	24	378.222	379.282	1.06		I think it goes like this	
53	24	380.837	381.597	0.76	alright		
53	24	382.392	383.582	1.19	Now what should we put together?		
53	24	383.782	384.432	0.65		umm	
53	24	384.952	388.892	3.94	What couple color do you think we should match up now?

53	24	401.827	402.607	0.78		I got this one	
53	24	402.962	406.242	3.28	Hmm..that piece looks like a corner piece. Look at the shape of the piece.		
53	24	407.927	408.817	0.89		oh yeah over here	
53	24	410.427	411.957	1.53		down, maybe down here	
53	24	411.997	412.647	0.65	could be		
53	24	412.807	413.547	0.74		could be	
53	24	413.777	417.527	3.75	do you think it moved on the top? Corner pieces have to be in the corner. I don't think they be in the middle		
53	24	419.037	421.207	2.17	You can use the top corner or the bottom corner		
53	24	421.957	423.407	1.45		### bottom corner	
53	24	423.007	424.267	1.26	Alright let's leave that guy there

53	24	461.112	461.762	0.65	the whale shark?		
53	24	461.882	462.772	0.89	It's pretty big		
53	24	463.692	464.542	0.85		pretty big	
53	24	464.642	465.822	1.18	Go ahead. Finish it up		
53	24	467.097	470.337	3.24		Maybe this one could go	
53	24	472.202	473.162	0.96		Maybe we	
53	24	473.837	475.907	2.07		Maybe we could try it this

53	24	482.267	483.087	0.82	I think so		
53	24	483.602	485.122	1.52	Why do you think that one goes in there?		
53	24	485.207	487.287	2.08		Maybe because, 'cause of the colors!	
53	24	487.302	489.112	1.81	The colors? yeah. It looks like the sand, right?		
53	24	489.012	489.292	0.28		yeah	
53	24	489.307	489.697	0.39	on the beach		
53	24	489.597	490.227	0.63		yeah on the beach	
53	24	494.137	497.032	2.895	that one looks like it goes somewhere around there		
53	24	497.032	498.162	1.13		I think it goes..right here!

53	24	524.079	525.279	1.2	and see if they fit		
53	24	526.424	527.344	0.92		no	
53	24	527.029	527.959	0.93	Try the other piece again		
53	24	528.089	530.509	2.42		I think it could go this way	
53	24	532.074	532.584	0.51		this	
53	24	532.974	534.744	1.77	There we go. Now you're cooking

53	24	548.269	549.829	1.56	And then he has a blue tail		
53	24	550.104	551.874	1.77	So it's got to go in there somewhere

53	24	572.094	572.894	0.8		Yeah it is	
53	24	572.989	577.239	4.25	That's the first thing we gotta look at. Look at how the edges look so you know right away where to put it		
53	24	584.959	586.749	1.79		This one looks like it's kissing	
53	24	586.749	588.589	1.84	*laughing* with its big mouth?		
53	24	588.594	589.434	0.84	like that *kisses*

53	48	762.995	766.325	3.33	Well it has a flat edge. So should it go on the bottom or the top? I don't know		
53	48	766.335	768.995	2.66		Maybe it should go right here	
53	48	768.94	769.46	0.52	Hmm		
53	48	769.885	770.255	0.37		*noises*

53	48	810.29	811.87	1.58	And that one's a corner		
53	48	812.155	813.365	1.21	And this one's a corner, right?		
53	48	813.485	815.115	1.63	So where do you think the corner piece should go?		
53	48	815.885	816.865	0.98		###	
53	48	818.52	819.92	1.4		Found the puzzle piece

53	48	836.975	838.445	1.47	Alright, that its goes there		
53	48	838.605	840.195	1.59	Perfect. Let's find another corner		
53	48	840.485	844.625	4.14		*gasp* I ### I think this one could go here	
53	48	844.66	846.31	1.65		if it's by a frog	
53	48	846.33	848.11	1.78	Yeah but it has to have a flat edge		
53	48	848.125	848.865	0.74		No	
53	48	848.9	850.01	1.11	Does it have a flat edge?		
53	48	850.01	850.6	0.59		Yeah	
53	48	850.61	852.17	1.56	Well flip it and see if it fits there		
53	48	853.485	854.665	1.18		Flip it?	
53	48	854.69	854.95	0.26	uh-huh

53	48	867.445	869.195	1.75	Where do you think that corner piece goes?		
53	48	870.085	871.025	0.94		*noises*	
53	48	870.155	871.645	1.49	Near the butterfly?

53	48	880.17	880.99	0.82		Mm-hmm	
53	48	881.135	883.075	1.94	I don't think that matches. Look at the wing

53	48	889.105	890.015	0.91		*laughing*	
53	48	890.015	895.025	5.01	So do you think this is a corner that goes here in the middle of the puzzle or should we flip it somewhere maybe it'll fit somewhere else		
53	48	895.705	897.065	1.36		Maybe it goes over here	
53	48	897.51	898.17	0.66		or here	
53	48	898.455	902.145	3.69	but then the flat edge. Remember? It's if it's a corner piece it has to go on one of these corners		
53	48	905.055	906.535	1.48		Maybe over here	
53	48	906.71	908.25	1.54	Alright, i think you're right		
53	48	909.885	911.445	1.56		Maybe this one could ###	
53	48	910.72	912.8	2.08	You want to try building the rest of the butterfly?		
53	48	913.055	913.985	0.93		sure!	
53	48	913.995	915.325	1.33	Look for the pieces that have blue

53	48	926.04	927.47	1.43	look for all the blue pieces		
53	48	931.85	935.33	3.48		Aah this one's not it so we need to take this one out	
53	48	934.835	940.845	6.01	So it has to be there somewhere, maybe you just don't know where it goes yet but if we connect some of these other ones then you'll find where it goes		
53	48	945.925	947.675	1.75	Do you remember where the tiger's face was?		
53	48	948.115	950.325	2.21	where? goes right around there right?

53	48	989.435	993.905	4.47	D- do the flat edges go in the middle of the puzzle or arou- around around the border?		
53	48	993.135	995.355	2.22		arou' around the border	
53	48	995.345	996.365	1.02	Mm hmm

53	48	1025.525	1028.765	3.24	There you go. Rotate the body around so you can find where it goes		
53	48	1032.71	1034.43	1.72		I just can't get it	
53	48	1036.925	1038.975	2.05		Maybe it should go over here	
53	48	1038.505	1039.255	0.75	alright

56	48	620.898	621.429	0.531		Yeah.	
56	48	622.021	622.808	0.787		A lot more s-	
56	48	623.307	623.723	0.416	A lot		
56	48	623.622	624.418	0.796		smaller ones.	
56	48	624.519	627.307	2.788	I know, smaller and all lots of the same color.		
56	48	629.83	631.335	1.505		This is going to be hard!	
56	48	631.418	632.843	1.425	I think its going to be hard.		
56	48	635.501	636.625	1.124		*noise*	
56	48	638.207	638.95	0.743	How should we do it?		
56	48	641.499	643.021	1.522		Let's, let's smoosh them up.	
56	48	643.229	644.432	1.203		Now, first.	
56	48	644.512	644.839	0.327	Okay		
56	48	656.813	657.442	0.629	Alright.		
56	48	658.903	660.434	1.531	Let's not let them fall though.		
56	48	662.339	663.542	1.203	Alright, what do we do first?		
56	48	665.105	665.53	0.425	What?		
56	48	666.056	666.834	0.778	That doesn't go there.		
56	48	667.318	667.956	0.638	You're silly		
56	48	667.995	668.438	0.443		*laughing*	
56	48	668.406	669.238	0.832	Let's find ones		
56	48	669.72	671.003	1.283	with two flat sides		
56	48	671.206	673.117	1.911	that go in the corners, thats how I like to do it.		
56	48	674.13	675.537	1.407	'cause then we can get the corners done.		
56	48	676.294	676.816	0.522		Like that?	
56	48	677.916	680.916	3.0	That could go there, yeah, bet you it might. But we don't know if it goes there		
56	48	681.46	682.399	0.939	Or if it goes there		
56	48	683.303	684.206	0.903	Or if it goes there.		
56	48	685.006	685.82	0.814	Or if it goes there.		
56	48	685.922	687.223	1.301	It could go four different places.		
56	48	689.46	690.336	0.876		Well	
56	48	690.601	690.823	0.222		it	
56	48	691.3	692.619	1.319		goes like that	
56	48	691.415	692.627	1.212	Wanna put it there for now?		
56	48	693.586	695.011	1.425	Let's put it there for now. Let's see		
56	48	697.613	699.126	1.513	Oop! What do you think, that's a corner.		
56	48	700.523	702.32	1.797	I don't know which corner though we have to find		
56	48	702.717	704.611	1.894	First we have to find another thing that looks like this.		
56	48	705.789	706.391	0.602	### go there		
56	48	706.643	708.236	1.593	Do you see something else that looks like that?		
56	48	710.518	711.226	0.708	What do you think that is?		
56	48	713.016	713.53	0.514	Plants?		
56	48	714.711	715.215	0.504		Maybe.	
56	48	716.619	717.822	1.203		That doesn't ### there	
56	48	717.799	720.817	3.018	Probably goes down here 'cause plants usually don't grow like that.		
56	48	721.506	722.205	0.699	They grow up.		
56	48	723.219	724.325	1.106	Do you see another plant?		
56	48	724.635	726.033	1.398	That one that looks like that plant.		
56	48	727.011	728.135	1.124		Hmmm...	
56	48	728.728	729.002	0.274	Yeah?		
56	48	729.533	730.214	0.681	See another one?		
56	48	731.408	731.709	0.301	Yep.		
56	48	732.359	733.129	0.77	Let's try to put these-		
56	48	733.102	733.518	0.416		###	
56	48	733.872	734.226	0.354		Oh!	
56	48	734.505	735.027	0.522		What is that?	
56	48	735.345	736.133	0.788	Oh! That's an ant!		
56	48	736.372	736.814	0.442	Oh look it!		
56	48	737.004	737.633	0.629	Look what I did!		
56	48	739.154	739.72	0.566		Good job!	
56	48	739.707	740.636	0.929	Where do you think that goes?		
56	48	744.995	745.419	0.424	Hmm		
56	48	745.596	748.605	3.009	I think there's probably not, no, I think there's probably an another piece that looks like that plant. 		
56	48	748.954	749.653	0.699	Maybe right here?		
56	48	751.909	752.432	0.523	*gasp*		
56	48	752.519	754.617	2.098	There you go! Where do you  think this, these three pieces go?		
56	48	755.935	756.413	0.478		Hmm	
56	48	758.194	758.911	0.717	Which corner?		
56	48	765.415	767.22	1.805	Yeah, that makes sense doesn't it? Good job.		
56	48	767.958	768.348	0.39	Alright		
56	48	769.219	770.52	1.301	### the top of this plant?		
56	48	773.314	776.226	2.912		Let's find some more red but not this red.	
56	48	776.208	779.013	2.805	Yeah, thats an ant. We'll put that over- Do you see part of the ant?		
56	48	779.782	780.809	1.027	Then we'll put it over there		
56	48	781.816	784.33	2.514	I don't think that's part of the ant, that looks like a bird's beak.		
56	48	784.603	786.913	2.31	He's got fruit inside his mouth.		
56	48	787.167	787.91	0.743		Hmm	
56	48	788.569	790.153	1.584	Let's see if we can find more of the plant.		
56	48	790.894	791.354	0.46	plants.		
56	48	792.309	793.814	1.505	Long red stringy plants.		
56	48	794.81	795.5	0.69		Let me see that	
56	48	796.15	796.628	0.478		piece.	
56	48	799.123	799.734	0.611		Hmm	
56	48	800.628	803.619	2.991	No, I don't think thats the same ant, there's two ants maybe.		
56	48	806.598	808.819	2.221	I don't think thats right sweetie, because he needs the top of his head.		
56	48	810.296	811.897	1.601	Here! What's that? There's another plant.		
56	48	812.974	814.824	1.85	These are all, these all look the same, don't they?		
56	48	816.032	817.705	1.673	Don't you want to put those together? See if they  		
56	48	817.97	818.82	0.85	see if they go together?		
56	48	821.927	823.626	1.699	No, see if these three go together?		
56	48	826.49	826.818	0.328	Oop!		
56	48	827.11	828.012	0.902	Yeah! That looks right.		
56	48	830.019	830.709	0.69	Umm...		
56	48	831.315	832.014	0.699	No...		
56	48	832.332	833.226	0.894	That doesn't seem right.		
56	48	833.727	834.329	0.602		Yeah it does!	
56	48	834.607	835.13	0.523	It does?		
56	48	835.288	836.642	1.354	Oh yeah! You're right! It does.		
56	48	838.713	839.819	1.106	I think it goes in there.		
56	48	840.843	841.312	0.469	No		
56	48	842.285	844.426	2.141	I don't think so. That has a big long ###		
56	48	845.315	847.209	1.894	But I bet you it goes around here somewhere.		
56	48	848.574	849.566	0.992	Alright, let's leave these here.		
56	48	850.177	850.496	0.319	'kay?		
56	48	851.423	854.432	3.009	I bet you they grow, th- there like that or grow like that.		
56	48	855.016	858.131	3.115		Well, that, well it goes like that side.	
56	48	858.914	859.622	0.708		So maybe	
56	48	859.104	859.511	0.407	Okay		
56	48	859.807	860.417	0.61		It ###	
56	48	859.816	860.294	0.478	Maybe		
56	48	861.519	865.13	3.611		I bet you there's a plant thats next to it.	
56	48	865.148	867.617	2.469	Okay, we'll see. Let's see if we can find more plants.		
56	48	868.406	868.813	0.407	Oop!		
56	48	868.914	870.463	1.549	What do you see here, what do you think that is?		
56	48	870.798	872.409	1.611		A butterfly!	
56	48	871.908	874.324	2.416	Yeah, let's find all the butterfly pieces.		
56	48	876.819	878.217	1.398	Do you see black spotted		
56	48	878.519	881.811	3.292	ones? The more of the butterflies. Get all the butterfly pieces together. 		
56	48	882.178	883.204	1.026	See if you can do that.		
56	48	889.8	891.428	1.628	Do you think you can put the butterfly together?		
56	48	893.201	894.121	0.92		Hmm, maybe.	
56	48	895.209	896.112	0.903		*cough*	
56	48	899.898	900.499	0.601		Uh-oh.	
56	48	901.388	902.388	1.0	*gasp* Don't push it.		
56	48	904.446	905.012	0.566	I'll get it.		
56	48	908.164	910.819	2.655	See if you can get the *grunt* butterfly together.		
56	48	915.004	916.349	1.345	I'ma do the tiger, OK?		
56	48	916.899	917.306	0.407		huh	
56	48	917.345	918.106	0.761	Want to do the tiger?		
56	48	919.115	920.186	1.071		Woops, woopsies.	
56	48	920.686	921.411	0.725	Tiger eyes?		
56	48	922.308	922.724	0.416		Sure.	
56	48	924.482	925.137	0.655	Tiger eye?		
56	48	925.334	925.812	0.478		Yep!

56	48	940.609	940.901	0.292	Oop!		
56	48	941.699	942.522	0.823	Do you think that?		
56	48	943.303	945.409	2.106	Mmm, no, I don't think that's right.		
56	48	946.012	947.605	1.593	I bet ya 'cause its part tiger, see?		
56	48	948.39	950.612	2.222	Where's the tiger's, what is that? What part of the tiger is that?		
56	48	950.797	951.815	1.018		Nose.	
56	48	951.602	954.018	2.416	Where's his nose when I said ### his eyes.		
56	48	954.159	955.752	1.593	That's his eyes, where does his nose go?		
56	48	957.206	958.012	0.806	Would it go up here?		
56	48	960.205	961.107	0.902	You think it goes like that?		
56	48	962.191	962.811	0.62	Goes like that.		
56	48	963.105	963.812	0.707		*noise*	
56	48	965.803	967.387	1.584	I don't think it goes like that, I think that's		
56	48	967.893	968.733	0.84	I think it may be		
56	48	969.511	970.202	0.691	Goes like that?		
56	48	970.418	970.807	0.389	Try it.		
56	48	973.809	975.314	1.505	Or do you think, it goes like this?		
56	48	979.681	980.425	0.744	Let's try that.		
56	48	985.001	985.895	0.894	Does that look right?		
56	48	985.886	986.196	0.31		Yeah!	
56	48	986.249	986.904	0.655	Yeah.		
56	48	987.398	989.203	1.805	Then the butterfly parts go in there and that		
56	48	996.604	999.914	3.31		But we have still a little bit of time.	
56	48	1000.123	1000.512	0.389	Mm-hmm		
56	48	1000.675	1001.498	0.823	We got lots of time.		
56	48	1001.915	1003.11	1.195	We're not in a hurry		
56	48	1004.01	1004.249	0.239	S-		
56	48	1004.404	1005.82	1.416	Oh! Did you get the butterfly put together?		
56	48	1006.016	1006.423	0.407		Yes.	
56	48	1006.505	1007.921	1.416	*gasp* good boy.		
56	48	1008.268	1008.622	0.354		See?	
56	48	1008.83	1009.608	0.778	Good job.		
56	48	1010.867	1011.92	1.053	Where do these parts go?		
56	48	1013.799	1014.33	0.531	Yeah?		
56	48	1016.088	1016.876	0.788	I think that looks right.		
56	48	1018.406	1020.504	2.098		But it has a pink ###	
56	48	1020.294	1023.851	3.557	That's, that's purple, I guess purple. Oh yeah, maybe not.		
56	48	1025.007	1026.193	1.186	Hmm, maybe that way?		
56	48	1028.791	1029.339	0.548	What you think?		
56	48	1030.111	1031.527	1.416	I don't know, you know what we'll have to do?		
56	48	1033.297	1034.731	1.434	Let's try to find more of the tiger.		
56	48	1040.88	1042.615	1.735	I think that goes like that, what do you think?		
56	48	1042.61	1043.318	0.708		Butterfly.	
56	48	1043.552	1044.72	1.168	I bet you this goes on top.		
56	48	1047.997	1048.722	0.725	Just like that		
56	48	1050.133	1053.133	3.0		Oh, there's tiger pieces right there.	
56	48	1051.814	1052.186	0.372	Yeah		
56	48	1053.166	1057.007	3.841	There are tiger pieces, I bet you that goes like that. Oh! Look at that!		
56	48	1057.712	1059.004	1.292	It's coming together!		
56	48	1062.41	1065.198	2.788		We, we have still a lot of pieces.	
56	48	1065.034	1066.725	1.691	We do have a lot of pieces.		
56	48	1067.087	1069.113	2.026	Oop! What is that? That's the middle of the butterfly!		
56	48	1069.467	1069.786	0.319		Huh?	
56	48	1070.119	1071.633	1.514	Oh my gosh! And what is this right here?		
56	48	1072.588	1073.004	0.416		Spots	
56	48	1072.607	1074.704	2.097	Spots, from the tiger's cheek?		
56	48	1074.889	1075.111	0.222		Oh.	
56	48	1077.006	1077.413	0.407		Oh.	
56	48	1077.603	1078.417	0.814	Oh!

70	48	105.66	106.82	1.16	Uh-oh, we're losing them.		
70	48	111.715	114.115	2.4	*laughing* From Turbo?		
70	48	114.14	114.59	0.45		Yeah.	
70	48	115.11	115.64	0.53	*laughing*		
70	48	116.36	123.52	7.16	I asked Harmony which one does she like better, Despicable Me 2 or Turbo. Which one you like better?		
70	48	123.895	126.285	2.39		I like all.	
70	48	126.625	130.155	3.53	That's the same thing Harmony said. No, you have to pick one. I said which one do you like better?		
70	48	131.58	139.47	7.89		I like Spookoo Me- Spicable Me better and Turbo better.	
70	48	134.15	135.5	1.35	Yeah, me too.		
70	48	136.98	137.53	0.55	Hey, look.		
70	48	139.62	141.59	1.97	Ok, where you think this one goes?		
70	48	142.02	144.09	2.07		*noises*	
70	48	144.05	150.72	6.67	See the corner? It either could go there- it wouldn't go there, it- or there.		
70	48	151.28	153.22	1.94	Mmm, I think it goes there.		
70	48	154.145	155.145	1.0		Think it goes...	
70	48	154.71	157.5	2.79	It wouldn't go here. Can't fit.		
70	48	157.96	159.48	1.52	It goes straight up and down.		
70	48	160.245	164.115	3.87	Plus, that other red plant was up there with the ants.		
70	48	164.925	167.905	2.98	This one was up here. Come on, help me.		
70	48	168.525	168.905	0.38		*noises*	
70	48	170.44	172.9	2.46		What if it's just a ###?	
70	48	170.845	171.895	1.05	### 'em on.		
70	48	172.425	173.685	1.26	Where does this one go?		
70	48	175.46	176.98	1.52	Mm-hmm, put it up there.		
70	48	179.505	180.195	0.69	All the way up.		
70	48	181.345	182.715	1.37	All the way up in the corner.		
70	48	183.515	187.815	4.3	I don't know if it- pieces fit. Oh, it does go there! Good job, RJ!		
70	48	185.32	186.22	0.9		He fits.	
70	48	188.24	194.45	6.21	Ok, so let's start with this corner. So look for all the pieces with the ant or with this red plant.		
70	48	195.325	204.185	8.86	See, like here's one. Let's put it on the board. Here's another one. And then we can start just putting those together first.		
70	48	203.72	206.88	3.16		And then- I don't think it fits this way.	
70	48	207.46	212.25	4.79	No, it doesn't, 'cause see the picture doesn't match. So let's just see what else you can do next.		
70	48	211.925	218.975	7.05		*singing*	
70	48	212.795	219.035	6.24	What about any of these? What about these? Any green ones?		
70	48	219.055	219.625	0.57		Hmm.	
70	48	220.245	224.045	3.8	This looks like an ant, but it looks like it goes down at the bottom.		
70	48	223.93	224.83	0.9		Hmm.	
70	48	225.415	226.395	0.98	Does that work?		
70	48	227.0	230.83	3.83	Does it? Let me see. Hold on, wait, I think you got it.		
70	48	231.93	232.84	0.91		It matches.	
70	48	232.94	238.3	5.36	No, it doesn't fit. Let's try- no, it doesn't Rodney *laughing*		
70	48	235.325	236.595	1.27		It does fit!	
70	48	239.445	241.195	1.75	See? It moves out too easily.		
70	48	241.65	246.53	4.88	This is probably going to go either up here or over here.		
70	48	248.695	250.815	2.12	Mm-hmm, confusing. Let's see.		
70	48	253.87	255.11	1.24	How 'bout this one?		
70	48	255.795	257.845	2.05	Does that go right there? No.		
70	48	258.065	258.935	0.87		No.	
70	48	258.785	260.425	1.64	It doesn't go there. What about down here?		
70	48	261.25	264.3	3.05	*gasp* my, oh wow, got it!		
70	48	262.0	262.91	0.91		Yes.	
70	48	265.08	266.87	1.79		Oh, this goes in here.	
70	48	265.97	268.42	2.45	It's flat, so it's gonna go on a flat side.		
70	48	268.54	274.83	6.29	If it has a flat piece- look, look, look- look at me. Out of my way. If it has a flat side it goes to a wall.		
70	48	274.65	275.27	0.62		Hmm.	
70	48	275.535	279.165	3.63	Rodney, are you paying attention? It has a corner. It goes in a corner.		
70	48	280.215	281.595	1.38	Flat side goes on a flat side.		
70	48	282.0	284.65	2.65	What about trying- oh, there, see? That works.		
70	48	284.97	287.46	2.49	No, I'm sorry, it won't 'cause it's a flat side.		
70	48	288.78	290.1	1.32	So it goes like...		
70	48	292.045	293.495	1.45	Maybe it's over here, I don't know.		
70	48	293.725	300.035	6.31	Let's see, some of the pieces go with the hand. Oh, this one. This looks like those, right? See where that goes.		
70	48	307.705	308.785	1.08		No.	
70	48	309.63	311.77	2.14	It doesn't go on a wall 'cause it's not a flat side.		
70	48	312.605	316.205	3.6	How about trying to- trying to-		
70	48	317.23	319.02	1.79	*laughing*		
70	48	317.93	319.35	1.42		*laughing*	
70	48	319.645	320.395	0.75	Got it!		
70	48	321.795	325.405	3.61	Now, let's see, are the ants over here? I can't remember.		
70	48	325.885	327.705	1.82		*noises*	
70	48	330.73	331.37	0.64	Hmm?		
70	48	331.715	333.185	1.47		The ants are...	
70	48	333.665	335.535	1.87	They right- like here somewhere?		
70	48	335.68	338.22	2.54	Wait a minute, this ant doesn't- do you think he goes right there?		
70	48	340.815	347.605	6.79	Doesn't fit- nope, it doesn't fit. You can't force it. If they fit, then they go in easily.		
70	48	348.415	352.135	3.72	If they don't fit then they- *laughing*		
70	48	351.96	353.28	1.32		*laughing*	
70	48	355.285	357.365	2.08	Nope, doesn't fit. Don't force it.		
70	48	356.21	356.73	0.52		Nope.	
70	48	358.295	362.725	4.43	So that goes there. What about this one? Where do you think that one goes?		
70	48	366.035	367.265	1.23	Try right here.		
70	48	369.285	378.335	9.05	You gotta look at the picture. See, does that color match? Look, look, look- look at me. These colors don't match, right? So don't even press it. What about right here though? 'Cause that looks like that.		
70	48	382.255	383.735	1.48	That doesn't match, son.		
70	48	389.58	393.53	3.95	Good job, good job! So, let's see.		
70	48	394.31	396.96	2.65	Hmm, what's next?		
70	48	397.35	403.09	5.74	I think these guys might be down here. *gasp* Wait, I got an idea. What about this? Look, look.		
70	48	404.215	407.585	3.37	That goes to somebody's feet, right? No.		
70	48	409.585	411.605	2.02	*laughing* We did it.		
70	48	412.995	414.525	1.53	We're missing something.		
70	48	413.935	416.075	2.14		*noises*	
70	48	415.84	416.94	1.1	Aah...		
70	48	418.035	421.175	3.14		*singing*	
70	48	422.26	424.76	2.5		These go to somebody's feet.	
70	48	424.86	427.27	2.41	Does it? Oh yeah, try it. You good.		
70	48	427.97	431.72	3.75	You got it. Ok, then- let's get this over with.		
70	48	432.09	434.8	2.71		I wonder if it goes like this.	
70	48	435.04	441.95	6.91	It's a flat side. Where do the flat sides go? To the wall, right? So make it touch the wall and then fit it.		
70	48	443.465	451.955	8.49	Huh-uh. The flat side has to go into the walls. The flat side goes there, there, here, here. Try to make it fit down here somewhere.		
70	48	456.765	462.035	5.27	Yeah, put it- *noises*. Good job *laughing*		
70	48	458.965	464.925	5.96		*laughing* Now it looks like a spider.	
70	48	465.3	466.73	1.43	*laughing*		
70	48	465.56	469.61	4.05		It does because up close to it- and...	
70	48	473.28	474.3	1.02	Look what I found.		
70	48	474.005	475.435	1.43		And the legs.	
70	48	475.435	477.555	2.12	This one goes on that side, not on this side.		
70	48	477.01	478.2	1.19		*laughing*	
70	48	478.93	483.28	4.35	Ok, let's start- *noises*		
70	48	480.85	484.77	3.92		Let's start... *noises*	
70	48	484.155	485.435	1.28	Where does the butterfly go?		
70	48	485.52	487.11	1.59		Where does the butterfly go?	
70	48	487.04	490.33	3.29	Really? Alright, that's what you're gonna do now? You're gonna mock me? For real?		
70	48	490.06	491.93	1.87		*laughing* You gonna mock me? For real?	
70	48	491.81	492.96	1.15	I'm serious, RJ.		
70	48	492.75	494.28	1.53		I'm serious, RJ.	
70	48	494.47	497.22	2.75	I'm very serious, RJ. Look, I found another piece.		
70	48	495.58	497.33	1.75		I'm very serious, RJ.	
70	48	497.66	501.21	3.55	While you're mocking me, I'm finishing the puzzle before you. I'm gonna win.		
70	48	497.95	498.34	0.39		*noises*	
70	48	501.42	502.4	0.98		I'm gonna win.	
70	48	502.215	503.445	1.23	No, you're not.		
70	48	503.585	506.955	3.37		Aah, where is- does this go?	
70	48	507.905	513.315	5.41	Well, ok, he goes with some butterfly pieces. So let's start doing the butterfly.		
70	48	512.865	519.105	6.24		*noises*	
70	48	518.65	520.2	1.55	Ok, put 'em on here now.		
70	48	520.69	527.76	7.07		*noises*	
70	48	520.72	523.97	3.25	Which s- which side is the butterfly on?		
70	48	527.87	531.11	3.24		They should have a paper that we look on.	
70	48	528.095	528.975	0.88	Do you remember?		
70	48	530.84	532.96	2.12	No, come on, here. You supposed to remember.		
70	48	531.605	534.695	3.09		'Cause- 'cause I was looking on the other one.	
70	48	533.875	536.005	2.13	You were supposed to remember for me.		
70	48	537.085	538.755	1.67	Here, come on, let's hurry up.		
70	48	538.555	543.195	4.64		*noises*	
70	48	540.04	543.19	3.15	*noises*		
70	48	543.6	545.0	1.4	Let's make these pieces fit.		
70	48	545.37	550.52	5.15		Do some cheetahs- do some cheetahs eat...	
70	48	546.815	548.285	1.47	Here? No.		
70	48	548.905	551.695	2.79	Got another corner piece. Where does the corner piece go?		
70	48	552.375	553.065	0.69	Show me.		
70	48	554.185	555.735	1.55	Yep, good job.		
70	48	556.635	560.835	4.2	And that's gonna go... bam, found it.		
70	48	562.29	563.67	1.38	What about this one? You try that one.		
70	48	567.575	570.905	3.33	Bam! No, *laughing* psych.		
70	48	570.585	573.105	2.52		But it look- but it fits a little.	
70	48	571.28	572.37	1.09	*laughing* Look at this one.		
70	48	574.13	577.8	3.67	Yeah, but the pictures don't match, see? They have to blend.		
70	48	578.495	583.275	4.78	Maybe it's just something in between here. Maybe there's another piece that goes in between that one.		
70	48	587.48	592.0	4.52	What about... We need a flat one- put your foot down, man.		
70	48	593.28	594.7	1.42	Hmm.		
70	48	594.635	595.875	1.24		Hmm.	
70	48	598.02	600.81	2.79	Kinda. Wait, this goes here, RJ, look at that.		
70	48	601.28	603.08	1.8	But the mushrooms are upside down.		
70	48	603.045	613.365	10.32		*laughing*	
70	48	605.53	606.33	0.8	What?		
70	48	607.025	608.905	1.88	But it- hold on, it matches though.		
70	48	609.53	613.47	3.94	No, the flat side goes- the flat side goes to the wall.		
70	48	617.685	627.305	9.62	No, it doesn't match. Wait, hold on. It does match! See that  little piece of mushroom? That's crazy. Ok, now try your...		
70	48	619.41	627.3	7.89		*laughing* Why is...	
70	48	630.09	631.98	1.89	No, that doesn't go very good.		
70	48	632.65	633.48	0.83	Try this one.		
70	48	634.39	637.9	3.51		*noises*	
70	48	641.04	642.53	1.49	No, doesn't match.		
70	48	641.8	642.45	0.65		No.	
70	48	643.4	645.63	2.23	Let's see, *noises*		
70	48	645.32	647.23	1.91		*noises*	
70	48	646.8	647.49	0.69	Seriously?		
70	48	647.93	648.82	0.89		Seriously?	
70	48	649.36	651.19	1.83	Maybe this goes on a wall.		
70	48	651.52	652.81	1.29		Yeah, maybe.	
70	48	654.79	657.4	2.61	I'm so confused. I'm just gonna leave it there for now. Ok.		
70	48	657.98	659.2	1.22	And...		
70	48	659.805	663.475	3.67		Hmm, let's do that one. Wait!	
70	48	661.775	662.905	1.13	W- w- wait.		
70	48	663.365	664.375	1.01	What's up? What's up?		
70	48	666.855	669.915	3.06	What about it? They match! Yeah, that's what I was saying.		
70	48	668.85	669.64	0.79		Yeah!	
70	48	670.49	672.63	2.14	This one- look, where does that one go?		
70	48	670.51	671.42	0.91		They match.	
70	48	679.995	680.715	0.72	Good job.		
70	48	682.4	683.37	0.97	And...		
70	48	684.04	685.06	1.02		*noises*	
70	48	685.555	688.175	2.62	Mmm... Look what I found.		
70	48	686.08	689.25	3.17		*noises*	
70	48	689.78	690.62	0.84		Bam!	
70	48	690.785	692.295	1.51	Bam! *laughing*		
70	48	691.815	692.595	0.78		Bam.	
70	48	693.02	696.66	3.64	Wait, let's see. Bam! I'm on a roll.		
70	48	695.535	696.305	0.77		Where is...	
70	48	697.735	698.695	0.96	I'm beating you, man.		
70	48	699.22	701.01	1.79		Aah, where does this go?	
70	48	701.655	708.475	6.82	How about- It's part- *laughing* It's- it's his nose. If that's his eye, where would his nose be?		
70	48	701.67	703.19	1.52		Oh, tartar sauce.	
70	48	703.85	708.82	4.97		*laughing*	
70	48	708.76	712.79	4.03	How 'bout- you could start doing the cheetah's face now. You could start making his face.		
70	48	713.58	716.32	2.74		Mmm. That's cheetah girl.	
70	48	716.035	717.935	1.9	*laughing*		
70	48	720.38	723.12	2.74	These are going away. Here, this is a piece of him.		
70	48	721.7	725.51	3.81		*noises*	
70	48	725.275	729.205	3.93	Oop, that doesn't fit. You can't force it. Doesn't fit. Try it a different way.		
70	48	727.875	733.985	6.11		*noises*	
70	48	731.085	732.055	0.97	Try it a different way.		
70	48	735.085	736.035	0.95	Try right there.		
70	48	739.425	750.025	10.6	How 'bout like this? Look, if it doesn't fit this way, then- think about it. No, it doesn't fit, you don't force it. You turn it around and try it the other way. Now try it.		
70	48	758.97	759.9	0.93	It fits!		
70	48	759.83	760.74	0.91		It fits!	
70	48	760.52	761.96	1.44	Where does his nose go?		
70	48	764.485	765.845	1.36		I don't know.	
70	48	766.33	767.51	1.18	His nose?		
70	48	769.635	770.325	0.69		*noises*	
70	48	770.31	771.89	1.58	Just put his nose on.		
70	48	772.715	776.535	3.82		*laughing* I don't... know.	
70	48	776.3	777.73	1.43	You could try it.		
70	48	779.01	781.5	2.49	Let's see, this goes somewhere too.		
70	48	782.73	785.14	2.41	Does that go there? No, it doesn't.		
70	48	786.01	789.36	3.35		*laughing*	
70	48	788.295	791.595	3.3	Let me see. We're missing some pieces here.		
70	48	790.48	792.45	1.97		That one look like...	
70	48	794.28	799.3	5.02		Ooh, Pokey and... Pokey and...	
70	48	800.765	801.815	1.05	What?		
70	48	804.165	805.485	1.32		Pokey and...	
70	48	807.065	810.925	3.86	Hmm, why does it feel like we're, like, missing stuff.		
70	48	809.85	813.49	3.64		And Spikey *noises*	
70	48	812.135	816.755	4.62	Ok look. Look, let me start it. We're getting there, RJ.		
70	48	817.33	819.46	2.13	We're missing something else.		
70	48	818.14	819.35	1.21		Cheetah-bat.	
70	48	819.59	820.73	1.14	Oh, right here.		
70	48	819.79	820.88	1.09		Bat-cheetah.	
70	48	821.555	822.635	1.08		Bat-cheetah.	
70	48	823.49	827.1	3.61		Cheetah-bat with weapons on his hand.	
70	48	827.15	829.52	2.37	Is this space upside down or something?		
70	48	829.03	830.42	1.39		*laughing* No.	
70	48	830.24	831.24	1.0	It's strange.		
70	48	832.165	836.715	4.55		Yeah, but it's not upside down.	
70	48	837.385	840.955	3.57		*noises*	
70	48	837.885	839.705	1.82	Mm-hmm.		
70	48	841.36	844.38	3.02		Remember when- the snake!	
70	48	842.215	843.245	1.03	Ok, what's next?		
70	48	844.185	848.605	4.42	I'm kind of seeing the snake a little bit, but umm- we're still kind of missing some...		
70	48	848.18	849.63	1.45		*noises*	
70	48	850.0	851.2	1.2	Maybe...		
70	48	850.575	852.685	2.11		You're missing the snake.	
70	48	853.065	854.175	1.11	Hmm.		
70	48	853.495	855.455	1.96		And this goes here.	
70	48	855.46	858.81	3.35	Just hold on, let me check it out down here right quick. Hold on, let me check.		
70	48	859.39	865.73	6.34		Aah, watch out *noises* The frog... Mommy you're missing something.	
70	48	865.445	874.315	8.87	Hey, wait a minute *laughing* You did it upside down. RJ, don't shove it in my face. We're doing it upside down right there. That's why it's messed up looking.		
70	48	874.005	876.095	2.09		Oh!	
70	48	875.285	877.835	2.55	I knew these mushrooms were upside down.		
70	48	878.335	882.515	4.18	Look, this is the way- aah, look it makes sense now. Look at this.		
70	48	883.655	886.405	2.75	Look. *laughing*		
70	48	883.795	887.645	3.85		*laughing* Aah!	
70	48	888.475	890.805	2.33	We had it mixed up *laughing*		
70	48	891.255	895.675	4.42	Ok, so I'm gonna take these and turn them around.		
70	48	891.345	891.935	0.59		*laughing*	
70	48	894.51	896.09	1.58		But that's right!	
70	48	896.255	898.575	2.32	Yeah, but it's on the wrong side.		
70	48	896.84	898.31	1.47		*noises*	
70	48	899.23	902.26	3.03		Yeah, but it's on the wrong side.	
70	48	899.57	901.41	1.84	That's why it wasn't making sense.		
70	48	899.885	900.335	0.45			15 minutes.
70	24	1422.734	1423.194	0.46			Start 24.
70	24	1425.879	1427.039	1.16	*laughing*		
70	24	1426.664	1427.644	0.98		Look in the back.	
70	24	1430.769	1433.729	2.96	This- This one should be quicker. There's some bigger pieces.		
70	24	1432.294	1435.104	2.81		*noises* Ooh, these are bigger.	
70	24	1433.854	1434.804	0.95			Experimenter exits.
70	24	1435.474	1436.724	1.25	Yeah, but ###.		
70	24	1436.114	1438.644	2.53		Turn 'em around, turn 'em around.	
70	24	1441.044	1447.994	6.95		I'm a- I could still take them apart.	
70	24	1444.264	1445.994	1.73	*singing*		
70	24	1446.864	1456.564	9.7	I like these more than the puzzles better than the- the cardboard ones. Yeah, cause Hannah chews on the cardboard ones. You used to chew on them.		
70	24	1459.489	1461.119	1.63	When Harmony would have them.		
70	24	1461.279	1468.799	7.52		You remember that other place where ###, with Hannah?	
70	24	1464.974	1465.884	0.91	Uh-oh, I dropped one.		
70	24	1467.274	1468.394	1.12	I dropped one.		
70	24	1468.549	1469.279	0.73	Yep.		
70	24	1469.899	1473.319	3.42		And Hannah was screaming- was grabbing my toe or...	
70	24	1473.524	1474.704	1.18	Yep, I remember.		
70	24	1474.464	1476.934	2.47		When I was supposed to scribble scrabble.	
70	24	1476.764	1478.514	1.75	Ok. I remember.		
70	24	1478.184	1478.814	0.63		*noises*	
70	24	1480.214	1480.694	0.48		Ok.	
70	24	1480.449	1481.799	1.35	Did they have puzzles there too?		
70	24	1482.039	1482.749	0.71		Huh?	
70	24	1482.489	1497.229	14.74	Ok, so you gotta remember. Where's the shark? At the top, on the right. Whale's at the bottom on the left. Starfish is in the right corner. Jellyfish is in the left top corner. Ok? Bam, bam, bam, bam. Those are the ones you remember.		
70	24	1486.909	1487.599	0.69		And...	
70	24	1498.919	1504.339	5.42	Ok, let's go. Now, I'm gonna try to beat you. I'm not gonna let you win this time.		
70	24	1505.079	1506.389	1.31		Why?	
70	24	1506.139	1508.069	1.93	*laughing* Because.		
70	24	1507.854	1511.834	3.98		*noises*	
70	24	1509.014	1511.854	2.84	I'm ready, I'm ready.		
70	24	1512.099	1513.239	1.14	*laughing*		
70	24	1515.054	1517.124	2.07	This doesn't have a wall piece, RJ.		
70	24	1518.414	1519.204	0.79		Mmm.	
70	24	1522.844	1524.134	1.29	Come on. Hurry up.		
70	24	1530.199	1530.789	0.59	No.		
70	24	1532.484	1532.964	0.48	This one...		
70	24	1532.709	1533.179	0.47		Yep.	
70	24	1533.939	1535.469	1.53	No, it doesn't go there.		
70	24	1535.989	1537.119	1.13		Yes, it does.	
70	24	1536.969	1538.409	1.44	No, I'm gonna start with the shark.		
70	24	1539.089	1543.019	3.93	With the sa-hark. Sa-hark.		
70	24	1542.899	1544.009	1.11		Hark.	
70	24	1543.859	1547.719	3.86	You know, like they say on, umm, Word World? Sa-hark.		
70	24	1556.495	1557.245	0.75		*noises*	
70	24	1557.885	1561.745	3.86	Oh wait, maybe the shark goes up here.		
70	24	1562.79	1563.52	0.73	Bam!		
70	24	1566.05	1568.2	2.15		And another guy was up there.	
70	24	1569.1	1570.41	1.31		Who's this guy?	
70	24	1571.08	1572.42	1.34	That looks like the whale.		
70	24	1573.845	1576.165	2.32	And a whale of a tale, and a tale of a whale.		
70	24	1574.57	1576.16	1.59		It looks like he goes up-	
70	24	1580.505	1583.955	3.45	No, they don't- the colors don't blend. The colors have to match.		
70	24	1584.42	1587.71	3.29	This one looks good. Does it go at the top or in the bottom?		
70	24	1588.75	1589.98	1.23	Looks like he goes at the top.		
70	24	1593.02	1609.3	16.28	It- this does not match that. You can't force it on it. How 'bout trying it a different way? Nope, 'cause those colors don't match either. Colors don't match. Just wait. His face probably goes right here. You have to find a differen- another piece to go next to it. Leave it in the corner.		
70	24	1611.13	1614.5	3.37	Huh-uh, right there. How 'bout this one? Try the piece.		
70	24	1619.94	1621.92	1.98	You have to lift it up and put it onto it.		
70	24	1628.405	1628.845	0.44		*noises*	
70	24	1629.75	1632.11	2.36	Lift it up and place it in. There you go.		
70	24	1632.975	1634.175	1.2	Mmm.		
70	24	1634.975	1636.945	1.97	Finished this top corner. Good job.		
70	24	1640.515	1644.905	4.39	It looks like the same color, but it's not. It's not the same pattern or color.		
70	24	1646.205	1651.555	5.35	Huh-uh. That goes- that's- this is- look, this is a crab. You see crab legs? *laughing* That's not a crab.		
70	24	1652.785	1657.895	5.11	And the colors are different, ok? So here, try this one.		
70	24	1665.005	1665.905	0.9	Good job.		
70	24	1670.72	1672.89	2.17	Nope, this goes to a wall.		
70	24	1673.49	1676.41	2.92	This is flat, now. Goes to the wall.		
70	24	1677.04	1678.23	1.19		This is a wall.	
70	24	1681.93	1683.02	1.09	Mmm.		
70	24	1682.78	1683.72	0.94		Hmm.	
70	24	1683.985	1685.035	1.05	How 'bout...		
70	24	1686.925	1689.195	2.27		How 'bout we supposed to ### this?	
70	24	1690.865	1692.855	1.99	Umm, does that work? Yeah, it does work.		
70	24	1693.305	1697.125	3.82	Oh, this one goes right here, we're gonna find that one. How about this one? Try it out.		
70	24	1698.28	1699.2	0.92		Mmm.	
70	24	1702.595	1705.985	3.39		###. Yeah, it does. There.	
70	24	1706.125	1707.585	1.46	*laughing* Good job.		
70	24	1708.58	1709.98	1.4		Sea-star.	
70	24	1711.025	1712.905	1.88	What corner was the sea-star in?		
70	24	1715.87	1717.19	1.32	Good job.		
70	24	1718.365	1719.815	1.45	And...		
70	24	1723.095	1724.495	1.4	*laughing*		
70	24	1725.933	1733.443	7.51		This goes right here. That goes right there. This goes right here. That goes right there. This goes right here. That...	
70	24	1731.563	1734.343	2.78	Look, I found him while you doing that. I made the crab.		
70	24	1738.088	1739.638	1.55		Where does the sea-star go?	
70	24	1738.488	1739.778	1.29	Try that piece.		
70	24	1749.248	1750.198	0.95		Hmm.	
70	24	1750.188	1754.728	4.54	Huh-uh. Look at the colors. Where is- where do you see this color? Where you see crab?		
70	24	1758.033	1761.253	3.22	Mmm, not quite. Try a different way. Turn it around a different way.		
70	24	1766.078	1768.198	2.12		This looks like a shark.	
70	24	1768.193	1778.323	10.13	Yes, so think about it- let's turn it- let's- aah maybe it's not, but here, we know that we have the crab down here, right? So let's see. Oh no, that doesn't fit there.		
70	24	1778.993	1781.843	2.85	What about there? Does it fit that way? Does it match?		
70	24	1783.643	1784.223	0.58		Yeah.	
70	24	1784.138	1786.518	2.38	Ok. Get another piece.		
70	24	1788.903	1791.613	2.71	Why don't you look for a piece that fits right here so you can finish this side?		
70	24	1792.723	1794.073	1.35		Where, this?	
70	24	1793.023	1795.453	2.43	Look for these colors. Where do you see these colors?		
70	24	1795.993	1797.203	1.21		I see this.	
70	24	1797.158	1803.228	6.07	No, no, no. Here, look for- look for these colors. It's missing pieces of the crab, so look for the crab color.		
70	24	1805.638	1813.498	7.86	Turn it- no, no, now don't just put it in there. Look f- turn it in a direction. Where's the crab on this piece? Where do you see the crab arms?		
70	24	1814.65	1819.17	4.52	Does his eye go with that? Does the ### eye go with the purple and ebony?		
70	24	1820.025	1820.565	0.54		No.	
70	24	1820.67	1822.82	2.15	Well, where do you see eye? You see eye there, right?		
70	24	1822.81	1823.63	0.82		Yeah.	
70	24	1823.285	1825.535	2.25	So make the eyes match.		
70	24	1826.185	1828.765	2.58	'Cause eyes go side by side.		
70	24	1828.92	1831.33	2.41	See? Good job.		
70	24	1831.54	1832.87	1.33	Try this one.		
70	24	1834.13	1838.26	4.13	Nope, it's not a corner piece. It needs two walls. Two sides.		
70	24	1840.57	1840.88	0.31		Mmm.	
70	24	1844.28	1845.04	0.76	Good job.		
70	24	1846.985	1849.715	2.73	This is a corner, right?		
70	24	1854.125	1856.525	2.4	Good job. Two left.		
70	24	1855.28	1855.96	0.68		Bam.

70	24	1869.605	1872.605	3.0	Final piece! Aah, think about it, that's the wall.		
70	24	1872.94	1874.69	1.75	It's a side piece, where is the wall?		
70	24	1874.84	1878.71	3.87	Hey, where does this- where does the flat- which side of this is the flat side?		
70	24	1879.36	1880.67	1.31	Show me the flat side down here.		
70	24	1880.94	1881.8	0.86		Right here.	
70	24	1881.495	1883.075	1.58	Ok, make it match.		
70	24	1884.41	1884.87	0.46			End 24.

79	48	59.065	63.805	4.74		Yeah we made an elephant one and a sheep one	
79	48	63.86	66.33	2.47	A sheep? Oh my goodness		
79	48	65.73	67.29	1.56		Yep and an elephant	
79	48	67.305	71.235	3.93	And an elephant? Okay well this one looks like it is a 		
79	48	71.235	72.135	0.9		A spider	
79	48	72.2	73.89	1.69	A spider		
79	48	74.74	76.26	1.52	yes		
79	48	79.415	80.145	0.73		huh-uh	
79	48	80.095	83.795	3.7	Oh look at that. That looks like it's gonna be a butterfly		
79	48	81.46	81.98	0.52		it's	
79	48	84.815	88.625	3.81	Maybe mama will do		
79	48	88.515	90.035	1.52		A butterfly. I'll do a butterfly	
79	48	89.86	91.31	1.45	Okay you do a butterfly		
79	48	91.53	98.25	6.72	And remember. How do the pieces go, on the edges. All of the pieces on the edges are		
79	48	99.185	100.075	0.89	flat!		
79	48	101.395	102.505	1.11		Does this go?	
79	48	102.52	105.44	2.92	Well is this piece flat? Like this one?		
79	48	105.94	106.33	0.39		no	
79	48	106.51	109.12	2.61	No. So then no it does not go		
79	48	109.89	110.69	0.8	Good job		
79	48	111.075	118.975	7.9	So maybe we could match up all the blues and see, ooh! Alright!		
79	48	119.24	125.59	6.35	We can match up all the colors of the butterfly. So what is that, blue and some, oop-		
79	48	125.6	126.49	0.89		doesn't fit	
79	48	126.48	127.54	1.06	doesn't fit		
79	48	127.725	131.325	3.6	Nope it doesn't. Could- do these dots match up? I don't think so		
79	48	131.58	133.14	1.56	Nope. I don't think so		
79	48	133.375	135.535	2.16		Maybe ###	
79	48	135.55	138.8	3.25	I don't know bud. Does this blue and this blue match?		
79	48	139.41	139.87	0.46		no	
79	48	142.105	143.315	1.21	Maybe it's purple		
79	48	143.505	145.015	1.51	I see some purple		
79	48	143.915	145.395	1.48		Maybe it's this one	
79	48	145.55	149.32	3.77	Maybe. Maybe we should try to put some blue and purple		
79	48	149.69	150.49	0.8		no	
79	48	152.375	154.785	2.41	It sure looks like a- maybe it goes on the other side		
79	48	158.695	160.955	2.26	Hmm. I don't think so		
79	48	161.15	163.63	2.48		No. No. Maybe *noises*	
79	48	165.155	165.965	0.81	*noises*		
79	48	166.315	167.425	1.11		Maybe it goes there	
79	48	167.695	168.455	0.76	Maybe		
79	48	168.66	171.6	2.94	Maybe. Does that match?		
79	48	171.365	172.225	0.86		no	
79	48	172.66	173.85	1.19	I don't think so		
79	48	173.88	176.14	2.26	I don't know. They are hard to tell		
79	48	176.345	178.615	2.27		It doesn't look like it matches	
79	48	178.125	179.945	1.82	It doesn't match. No I think it does.		
79	48	180.11	181.97	1.86	See if the dots were in line up		
79	48	182.105	183.245	1.14	look maybe		
79	48	185.46	193.19	7.73	I don't know. Let's try and find, let's try and find the rest of the butterfly. Let's put all of the blue and purple pieces		
79	48	193.32	196.26	2.94	together. Oh my let's see		
79	48	195.995	198.905	2.91		I found a blue one by the tiger's neck!	
79	48	196.445	197.005	0.56	there		
79	48	197.785	199.895	2.11	You did? Okay		
79	48	199.995	201.325	1.33	Oh! And look at this!		
79	48	202.025	202.885	0.86	What is this?		
79	48	202.97	203.52	0.55		tiger	
79	48	203.64	205.73	2.09	Yeah, and this looks like a tiger's eye		
79	48	203.92	204.29	0.37		and this-	
79	48	206.13	207.65	1.52	that maybe		
79	48	208.875	211.925	3.05	Well remember, all of the pieces on the edges- Cover your mouth		
79	48	213.945	215.885	1.94	All the pieces on the edges have to be flat		
79	48	216.53	217.92	1.39		What are we doing?	
79	48	216.82	219.44	2.62	Maybe we should put the ###		
79	48	220.235	221.035	0.8	What do you think?		
79	48	221.39	224.0	2.61	Do you think that you can put		
79	48	225.01	226.03	1.02		of the tiger	
79	48	225.485	230.085	4.6	The tiger. We'll just put him right in the middle. He doesn't have to be in the in the right spot just yet		
79	48	231.11	233.04	1.93		But what about the butterfly?	
79	48	233.04	236.88	3.84	Well we'll give- I think the butterfly and the tiger go together		
79	48	237.115	239.145	2.03		Oh	
79	48	238.165	241.435	3.27	So let's try and put the tiger		
79	48	239.595	243.745	4.15		And what, what is that lady doing in the ###	
79	48	243.825	246.375	2.55	Well she's just doing something else		
79	48	247.155	248.505	1.35	somewhere else		
79	48	249.105	251.825	2.72	Wow! okay just put it here		
79	48	251.96	257.21	5.25	Just put it together in here and then we'll leave it uh, alright let's see if we can find some of the other spots		
79	48	257.43	258.57	1.14		here's another one!	
79	48	258.625	259.255	0.63	okay		
79	48	259.435	261.005	1.57		*noises*	
79	48	260.765	261.725	0.96	We'll try!		
79	48	261.58	264.2	2.62		Can we- How do you open the door?	
79	48	262.035	264.305	2.27	Can you reach it? Maybe we should		
79	48	264.502	269.482	4.98	Well let's not think about opening, she's not gonna come back until we're done with the puzzle. 		
79	48	269.62	279.39	9.77	So let's let's move this down here, this puzzle's pretty big. Okay so let's match up all of the, animal spots		
79	48	271.56	272.33	0.77		*noises*	
79	48	276.765	277.655	0.89		animals!	
79	48	279.39	283.54	4.15		But how are we gonna figure out, which puzzles are we gotta figure out?	
79	48	280.175	280.925	0.75	okay		
79	48	283.56	286.47	2.91	Well let's do, let's do one animal at a time		
79	48	287.04	288.52	1.48	So look at all these pieces		
79	48	290.025	294.685	4.66		*noises*	
79	48	291.14	294.84	3.7	For. Where's the other, where's the other eye?		
79	48	295.01	298.0	2.99	Ooh! Good one! Where's the other part of the nose?		
79	48	299.835	300.355	0.52		*noises*	
79	48	301.185	304.265	3.08	Oh here's his noise on this side. His nose is on this side.		
79	48	307.095	308.375	1.28	Good job!		
79	48	308.615	310.005	1.39	Where is the other eye?		
79	48	310.16	312.53	2.37	He can't see. Only has one eye		
79	48	314.815	315.185	0.37		*noises*	
79	48	315.265	316.285	1.02	Alright!		
79	48	316.3	316.61	0.31		*noises*	
79	48	317.095	320.885	3.79	What does this, does that go do you think?		
79	48	318.22	319.13	0.91		*noises*	
79	48	321.175	326.675	5.5	Do you think it goes over there, or maybe		
79	48	323.395	323.705	0.31		no	
79	48	326.09	326.72	0.63		there!	
79	48	326.995	330.095	3.1	Hmm. I don't know about the stripes and the dots		
79	48	331.715	333.375	1.66	Where are the other dots?		
79	48	333.515	334.545	1.03	Where do the dots go?		
79	48	335.21	336.82	1.61	And then you turn it around		
79	48	340.165	341.405	1.24		Nope it doesn't match!	
79	48	341.425	343.315	1.89	It doesn't match? Can mama try?		
79	48	343.62	345.66	2.04	Maybe the dots up there		
79	48	346.45	348.84	2.39	Now let's find the butterfly!		
79	48	349.295	350.065	0.77	hmm

79	48	351.28	353.5	2.22	Okay. Ooh		
79	48	354.0	356.11	2.11	Let's see if we can get those dots to match		
79	48	356.255	357.685	1.43	You might have to turn it the other way		
79	48	360.0	361.02	1.02	Will that match?		
79	48	361.27	363.86	2.59		*noises*	
79	48	363.265	364.395	1.13	I don't think so		
79	48	366.67	368.7	2.03	Hmm. Oh! Here's some more dots!		
79	48	366.925	368.155	1.23		It doesn't match

79	48	382.76	383.25	0.49		no	
79	48	383.265	384.695	1.43	You don't think the dots go there?		
79	48	384.87	387.49	2.62	Cause it's got some blue of the butterfly		
79	48	387.68	388.83	1.15	You have to lift up		
79	48	390.875	391.895	1.02	Can you lift it?

79	48	412.575	413.815	1.24		This is a monkey	
79	48	413.845	416.135	2.29	That does look like a monkey. Well let's finish the butterfly!		
79	48	416.66	418.35	1.69	Let's finish the blue of the butterfly		
79	48	418.895	421.445	2.55	And maybe we'll finish the tiger spots		
79	48	421.94	423.5	1.56	Do we see any tiger spots?		
79	48	423.67	424.43	0.76		*noises*	
79	48	424.44	427.09	2.65	Well remember what goes on the bottom has to be flat		
79	48	427.725	428.955	1.23	What about up here?		
79	48	429.14	430.69	1.55	How bout turning it around		
79	48	431.685	433.365	1.68	So that the dots match		
79	48	434.095	435.945	1.85	So that the dots match

79	48	446.68	448.2	1.52	This way. Try that		
79	48	448.82	449.87	1.05	ta-da!		
79	48	450.975	453.275	2.3	Alright. So now what?		
79	48	453.775	462.335	8.56	Are there any other colors or dots that we need to put somewhere?		
79	48	463.445	464.925	1.48	What do you think?		
79	48	464.585	468.345	3.76		What is that, who is making that door noise?	
79	48	467.645	470.015	2.37	I don't know who's making that door noise		
79	48	470.24	472.89	2.65		Mayb- Maybe we'll have to go see and open the door!	
79	48	473.115	474.345	1.23	Well no we're not done		
79	48	474.99	477.51	2.52	Let's let's finish the puzzle. Then we can open the door		
79	48	477.6	478.24	0.64		###	
79	48	477.87	482.44	4.57	Where does this thing go? Should we put all of the pieces that are on the edges		
79	48	482.485	483.265	0.78	Look at oh!		
79	48	483.135	483.915	0.78		oh yeah!

79	48	488.39	488.59	0.2	okay		
79	48	488.625	491.365	2.74	I don't think it goes there. These always go on the edges		
79	48	491.405	492.955	1.55		*coughing*	
79	48	492.52	493.58	1.06	oh dear!

79	48	508.01	510.28	2.27		These puzzles are really hiding!	
79	48	512.815	513.885	1.07	Oh oh careful

79	48	538.795	539.075	0.28		no!	
79	48	539.885	541.425	1.54	Turn it around. Try it like that		
79	48	541.745	543.845	2.1	See if it matches. No!		
79	48	544.165	545.335	1.17	What do you think?

79	24	1340.021	1340.581	0.56		no	
79	24	1340.751	1342.061	1.31	K. Then it can't go on the top

79	24	1425.001	1427.291	2.29	Well does it fit that way? Maybe you should turn it around		
79	24	1427.406	1428.646	1.24	and around and around		
79	24	1429.576	1431.436	1.86	And we see, ta-da!

80	48	403.32	405.22	1.9		The snake's already up here.	
80	48	405.035	408.395	3.36	Where's the snake? Oh this yellow- the green snake, ok.		
80	48	407.91	412.01	4.1		*laughing* Yeah it's up there, it's so high. I already did one up there!	
80	48	409.825	410.605	0.78	*noises*		
80	48	411.58	414.04	2.46	Ok, do you see any- any other snake pieces?		
80	48	415.855	418.065	2.21		Maybe there could be here.	
80	48	417.855	424.305	6.45	Hmm, looks like- look. That bird looks like- is it the toucan, maybe?		
80	48	426.935	428.495	1.56	Or is it one of these leaves?		
80	48	428.9	430.83	1.93		It's this one of these leaves.	
80	48	430.23	433.18	2.95	Ok, but it doesn't look very much like a snake. *noises* this?		
80	48	432.19	433.01	0.82		Hey! I...

80	48	448.79	450.6	1.81		This fits here, but...	
80	48	450.215	452.915	2.7	I know, but it's too loose. You wanna try next here?		
80	48	454.85	456.68	1.83		Ooh, it does fit.	
80	48	456.16	458.98	2.82	Good. And do you wanna try the toucan?		
80	48	459.385	460.725	1.34	With the ### in its mouth?

80	48	467.87	469.46	1.59	Let's get the little toucan pieces.		
80	48	470.58	477.45	6.87		Toucans- do you know they pa- pass the other berry to the other one and try to play catch?	
80	48	477.31	479.37	2.06	Really? Who told you that?		
80	48	477.915	478.415	0.5		Yeah.	
80	48	479.31	481.22	1.91		"In ""Cat in the Hat"" they wrote that."	
80	48	480.84	481.97	1.13	Cat in the Hat? Ok.		
80	48	481.78	482.36	0.58		Yeah.	
80	48	483.235	484.265	1.03		*noises*	
80	48	484.135	487.615	3.48	So, this looks like a toucan piece. How about this?		
80	48	486.38	490.43	4.05		###, in lots of shows I watch stuff to make me learn.	
80	48	490.17	491.44	1.27	Mm-hmm.		
80	48	493.03	494.17	1.14	Going to the end?		
80	48	494.575	495.485	0.91		Yeah.	
80	48	496.085	497.615	1.53		Do we see the ants on here?	
80	48	499.165	500.975	1.81		Oh, they're like that.	
80	48	500.685	501.795	1.11	Mm-hmm.		
80	48	502.285	505.135	2.85		We need two f- ant faces.	
80	48	505.685	506.725	1.04		Here's one.	
80	48	506.65	507.7	1.05	Mm-hmm.		
80	48	507.93	515.69	7.76		And I need another red piece that looks like this- like- actually I don't. I think that ###.	
80	48	518.055	520.355	2.3	Do you think this is an ant piece, maybe?		
80	48	519.94	522.41	2.47		No! I already got it, see?	
80	48	520.65	521.74	1.09	It isn't?		
80	48	522.08	523.16	1.08	Ok, ok.		
80	48	523.635	527.095	3.46		Actually this does look like it'll fit. Yeah, it does.	
80	48	525.83	527.18	1.35	Mm-hmm.		
80	48	527.75	528.54	0.79		*noises*	
80	48	528.01	530.28	2.27	Oh! Whose legs could these be?		
80	48	530.73	532.85	2.12		Ants' leg.	
80	48	536.095	538.455	2.36		Mmm, there, it fits.	
80	48	538.52	539.62	1.1	There you go.		
80	48	540.465	542.075	1.61	Any other ant pieces do you see?		
80	48	542.235	543.615	1.38	I see one more mushroom.		
80	48	544.05	546.65	2.6		Hmm, there's one *noises*.	
80	48	547.155	549.155	2.0	Where are the other mushrooms in this picture?		
80	48	549.04	550.64	1.6		Oh, right here.	
80	48	550.925	552.925	2.0	Oh, there you go.		
80	48	553.56	557.02	3.46	Oh, more mushrooms here. I wonder if they connect  yet. Do you want to try?		
80	48	557.025	563.205	6.18		Yeah, but first I gotta crumble it up then. Actually I don't, it's like this.	
80	48	562.86	566.05	3.19	Mmm, nice, you got that connected.		
80	48	566.605	569.075	2.47		And then this.	
80	48	567.385	568.355	0.97	Ooh!		
80	48	569.995	570.715	0.72		There.	
80	48	571.51	573.3	1.79	Ok, very good.		
80	48	574.77	576.6	1.83	Now what, do you want to do the toucan?		
80	48	575.45	579.89	4.44		Now I just need long- no, I need longer legs for the ants.	
80	48	579.575	581.925	2.35	Oh, is it- are these legs maybe?		
80	48	583.065	585.645	2.58		No- oh yeah, these things are.	
80	48	583.74	584.88	1.14	These little things?		
80	48	587.105	592.835	5.73		###, I thought you were talking about these are legs. 'Cause these are just bushes.	
80	48	589.245	591.525	2.28	No, those are not legs.		
80	48	592.56	593.79	1.23	*laughing*		
80	48	595.7	598.39	2.69	So, what do you wanna do next? You wanna do the toucan?		
80	48	598.93	599.55	0.62		Mm-hmm.	
80	48	599.565	602.025	2.46	Ok, does this look like the toucan's eye?		
80	48	600.45	601.16	0.71		Act-	
80	48	602.33	603.1	0.77		Hmm?	
80	48	602.8	604.06	1.26	These look together.		
80	48	603.834	609.904	6.07		'Cause toucans' eyes are really colorful too a little bit, 'cause they're blue around.	
80	48	605.804	606.344	0.54	*noises*		
80	48	608.079	609.109	1.03	Mmm.

80	48	624.604	627.204	2.6	Does this look like the toucan's body or something?		
80	48	626.909	631.429	4.52		I think it's for this.	
80	48	632.034	632.584	0.55		No.	
80	48	632.184	634.654	2.47	Is it? How about the bottom of it?		
80	48	635.084	636.414	1.33		Yeah it is.	
80	48	636.864	637.434	0.57		There.

80	48	638.949	639.789	0.84	Mm-hmm.		
80	48	641.864	643.654	1.79		Ooh, there's a snake.	
80	48	643.334	648.314	4.98	I know, we gotta do the snake. Whose hand is this? Oh, it's the little lemur's.		
80	48	648.099	649.399	1.3		*laughing* Yeah.	
80	48	650.314	651.434	1.12	Where does that go?		
80	48	651.419	653.279	1.86		What is this stuff?	
80	48	653.234	659.794	6.56	Oh, NAME, I found it. Why are you with a leopard piece? I thought we were almost finished with the leopard.		
80	48	663.539	666.309	2.77	Ooh, the snake is coming out.		
80	48	668.579	672.109	3.53		Now where's another snake piece?	
80	48	671.369	673.499	2.13	Well, what is- what kind of piece ###?		
80	48	674.818	675.876	1.058		Leopards.	
80	48	675.499	676.644	1.145	One leopard?		
80	48	678.006	682.499	4.493	It's- oop, how about this? Does it look like an eye- I mean an ear of an animal?		
80	48	682.489	686.185	3.696		Uh-huh, so it'll go over here.	
80	48	685.922	688.488	2.566	Right. How about this ear? Where did this ear go?		
80	48	689.645	690.746	1.101	Was it this?		
80	48	690.658	692.064	1.406		I ###.

80	48	699.059	700.305	1.246	Good.		
80	48	701.846	704.947	3.101	What's next? So where does this toucan go in the picture?		
80	48	704.565	707.608	3.043		Look at the leopard. He's trying to look out.	
80	48	707.368	708.455	1.087	*laughing* Yeah.		
80	48	709.93	712.741	2.811	You wanna get it to sl- toucan all the way here?		
80	48	714.092	714.817	0.725		Mm-hmm.	
80	48	714.603	715.748	1.145	Ok.		
80	48	716.034	717.947	1.913		Think these are next to there.	
80	48	717.765	720.128	2.363	That's not- I don't- not yet.		
80	48	721.573	725.081	3.508	Do you see these little flowers? You wanna try these corner pieces here?		
80	48	725.581	728.262	2.681		No corner pieces around here.	
80	48	727.807	735.952	8.145	But- But the corner is like there- this corner? You see this corner in the picture? With the three flowers?		
80	48	735.183	741.69	6.507		Yeah, but look, that must have more brown. Oh yeah, ###.	
80	48	741.009	742.356	1.347	What about this one?		
80	48	743.214	749.069	5.855		Maybe it fits here. 'Cause toucans are usually black on the back.	
80	48	744.685	745.12	0.435	Does it?		
80	48	748.525	750.163	1.638	Mmm.		
80	48	750.765	753.33	2.565	More toucan here maybe? In the ###?		
80	48	752.837	755.895	3.058		Ooh, here's one! This fits here I think.	
80	48	755.958	758.553	2.595	Hmm, but let's remember this was already connected there.

80	48	780.808	782.445	1.637		It can't talk!	
80	48	783.857	790.436	6.579	Aah, look! *laughing* This thing is at the corner NAME, this little froggy. He's sitting on all the flowers like this.

80	48	799.045	801.205	2.16	Somewhere around here.		
80	48	801.779	805.475	3.696		Maybe he is sitting around one of these flowers.	
80	48	807.381	808.946	1.565		No.	
80	48	807.823	809.228	1.405	Mmm, not yet.
