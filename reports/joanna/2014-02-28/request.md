I have taken over for Claire as the RA working on the lab study about puzzle play with Raedy and Naveen. You did some analysis on our transcripts about a year ago. We were hoping you would be able to get some new counts for us. I have attached two transcript files. One has the entire puzzle transcripts and one has 15 minute puzzle transcripts. Could you please find counts for both of these files separately? I also attached a file with our word list. Before you find the counts, could you exclude all text that is in between "* *"? I do not think this is something you have done for this study in the past and if that will be overly complicated, please let me know and we can figure something else out. 

In each file, the first column marks the subject number. The second column marks the task that was being worked on (either 24 or 48 piece puzzle). 

We would like to get total tokens per speaker/per puzzle. So for subject number 10 we would like total word counts for 10_Child_24, 10_Child_48, 10_Parent_24, and 10_Parent_48. 

In addition, is it possible to get total types per speaker/per puzzle? It seems like this might be incredibly complicated, but we thought you might have done it in the past. Ideally, we would want different versions of a word (big, bigger, biggest) to be counted as one type. 

Finally, we would like each subject to have two rows, the first would show their totals for the 24 piece puzzle, the second would show their totals for the 48 piece puzzle. Also, each word in the list would have 4 columns associated with it. The columns would be as follows:

word, 

[Word]ChildTokens: count of times the child said [Word]

[Word]Parent1Tokens: count of times Parent 1 said [Word]

[Word]ChildTypes: if the child said [Word] at least 1 time, this will = 1, else = 0

[Word]Parent1Types: if Parent 1 said [Word] at least 1 time, this will = 1, else = 0

The README file you sent me is the first thing that I want and for that I want you to use the word list I sent. We want types and token counts for those specific words.

However, in addition to those counts, we would like to know, for each speaker (parent/child for each subject number), total word count and a count of the number of types of words they use for each puzzle. So for this second thing, I do not just want to know how many types they use from the attached listed--I want to know how many types of words they use total. I do not know if that is possible but Naveen thought you had probably done this for the program project before. 

So to be clear, for subject 10 child 24 piece puzzle we will want:

* how many times he uses each word on the list
* whether or not he uses each word on the list (1,0)

* the total number of words he uses (all words, not just those on the list)
* the total number of types of words he uses (all words, not just those on the list)
