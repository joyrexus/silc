Subject: Transcripts

I'm working with Raedy and Naveen on some language coding of transcripts and we were hoping that you would be able to pull out utterances that contain certain words. I have attached the transcripts and the word list. We would want the following columns to be represented in the output:

* Subject
* Puzzle - either 24 or 48, this is marked in column B of the transcripts I attached
* Line - the line the utterance appears on in the transcript
* Speaker
* Word
* Utterance

Let me know if you need any other information from me or if you have any questions.
