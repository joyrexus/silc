10	48		
10	48		No, can you do all of them?
10	48	Mm-hmm. Let's see, I'm gonna start with this beautiful butterfly

10	48	Straight	
10	48	Straight has to line up with straight, right? That straight edge	
10	48		
10	48		###
10	48	It has to keep going, the line has to keep going, the straight line has to keep going, hey! Where's the rest of my straight line?	
10	48	Where's the rest of my straight line? Try upside down so the straight lines match up	
10	48		Can you put it together
10	48	Lookit this, see look, see? Is that gonna be straight? Look look look, look. Straight, straight, straight! Yeah! We like to go- next to each other when we're- Oh! but that's not the right piece! *laughing*

12	48	Wait wait wait wait, why don't you try flipping it around?	
12	48	No wait, wait a second, that's not right	
12	48		I think
12	48	Oh, that's right, you're right. Okay	
12	48		Jaguar next
12	48	Hmm?	
12	48		After. Aft-
12	48	Well, finish the butterfly first	
12	48	That's not right	
12	48		Maybe, ###
12	48	Oh, it's an upside-down butterfly, you're right	
12	48	Or maybe we have this upside-down. Maybe this goes over here, what do you think?	
12	48		
12	48		Yes
12	48	I think you're right	
12	48		Here's another piece of a butterfly
12	48		Oh, this is a top piece
12	48	Mmm	
12	48		Maybe we will have to save it
12	48	Okay	
12	48		Because it
12	48	What if- If this is a corner piece, maybe it's on the bottom	
12	48		But there's no
12	48	Hmm	
12	48		Well, this have connection there, but it's purple
12	48		But there's purple right there
12	48		Mommy, the polka dots go on the edges
12	48	Mm-hmm	
12	48	Well maybe it's on the other edge	
12	48		The other edge?
12	48		Oh, maybe you, you are right!
12	48		
12	48	*laughing*	
12	48		You are like a barnacles
12	48

12	48	Barnacles?	
12	48	Alright. Do you see any other butterfly pieces?	
12	48		Yes! Yes!
12	48		This is a butterfly piece, and this-, this too. What should we do?
12	48		
12	48		I think this goes, It goes there!
12	48		And a little bit of blue on it
12	48		But no polka dots
12	48		I guess we ha-
12	48		Where could this puzzle piece- Where could this puzzle piece be?
12	48	*laughing*	
12	48		It has purple and blue in it so it, Oh!
12	48		
12	48	Oh!	
12	48	There ya go	
12	48		Oh this has, a piece on- A piece of a butterfly on it. I think it goes right there, because that has a mushroom and polka dots!
12	48		
12	48	I think you're right	
12	48		I am right
12	48	*laughing*	
12	48		See?
12	48		Aah
12	48	Alright, do we have any other blue butterfly pieces to find?	
12	48		There's one more

12	48	*laughing* Oh, look what else is on that piece	
12	48		a jaguar nose

12	48		
12	48		We finished the butterfly
12	48		Now onto the jag- The rest of the- Now onto the rest of the jaguar
12	48		
12	48		
12	48		
12	48		
12	48	Wow, you found those jaguar pieces fast!	
12	48		But, some of them I don't know where they go yet
12	48		
12	48		I recognize this piece
12	48	Hmm?	
12	48		I recognize this piece
12	48	You recognize that?	
12	48		Yeah
12	48		But I don't know where it goes. And where this piece- That piece goes there
12	48		
12	48		D-don't know where this- Oh maybe it could go here
12	48		No
12	48		Oh it goes right here
12	48		
12	48		Goes right there
12	48	So what's next?	
12	48		*sigh*
12	48		Well we- Well there's still a part of a jaguar's ear missing
12	48	Oh!	
12	48	Let's see if we could find it	
12	48		Where could that be?
12	48	Hmm	
12	48	Oh, does that look like a jaguar's ear?	
12	48		What?
12	48		Yeah
12	48		
12	48		It is a jaguar's ear
12	48	It didn't have any spots on it so it was tricky to see	
12	48		Here's the last piece
12	48		Mommy, that one's ears, ###
12	48		
12	48	Nice work	
12	48		Now onto the rest of the python
12	48		That's gonna be
12	48	Oh, the python?	
12	48		Yeah
12	48		Uh, what's, that's gonna be tricky though
12	48	There's a lot of green, so that's a little tricky	
12	48		Yeah, some are animals, maybe
12	48	Do you want to do this red plant first? Maybe that'll be easier	
12	48		'Kay
12	48		Uh, ### except the middle parts
12	48	Aah, I don't think that's right	
12	48		bu-
12	48		
12	48	Oh! There you go	
12	48		It's a butterfly plant, for butterflies
12	48		
12	48	I don't think that fits	
12	48		No, let's see if that piece, this piece goes in
12	48	Oh I think you were right about that other piece	
12	48		I was?
12	48	Yeah, here here lookit there's a little bit of the jaguar in here, just kinda- Oh, sorry! *laughing*	
12	48	Does it, does it fit?	
12	48		###
12	48		
12	48		Yes
12	48	Yeah	
12	48	Oh, this is a toucan!	
12	48	Isn't it? A toucan beak?	
12	48		Yeah!
12	48	So I don't think we're ready for that 'cause there's no toucan over here	
12	48		
12	48		Let's do the toucan next
12	48	Well should we finish this plant?	
12	48		Yes
12	48		I was just telling you we have to do the toucan next
12	48	Oh okay	
12	48		
12	48	Alrighty	
12	48	What about a corner piece?	
12	48	Do you see any corner pieces?	
12	48		That is gong to be hard. Oh, this is ### corner piece
12	48	Oh, there's a frog on that corner piece	
12	48		
12	48		Yeah
12	48	Alright	
12	48		Frogs like those corner pieces
12	48	*laughing* frogs like corner pieces?	
12	48		I mean, frogs like those kind of flowers
12	48	Oh, okay	
12	48		I bet you it goes on here
12	48	Oh, look at that	
12	48	So that must be up top somewhere, huh?	
12	48		It must be here
12	48		First we have to-
12	48		I have to-
12	48	Oh!	
12	48	No?	
12	48		I think it goes ###
12	48	That was a good try, I thought- It looked like it should fit there	
12	48		Yeah
12	48	But, Oh wait, Did you-	
12	48	No, no it doesn't	
12	48	It looks like it should though	
12	48		Hey this is part of a plant
12	48	Oh yeah!	
12	48		
12	48	Good eyes. I didn't see that	
12	48		Hey!

12	48	Huh. It's somewhere around here 'cause look at those little feet, and then there's little feet on there, too	
12	48	####	
12	48		I th- think, there's a lot of red. I think we should do the an- ants now
12	48	Well wait, do you wanna look for other parts of the toucan?	
12	48		Yeah
12	48		This is a part of a toucan
12	48	Oh	
12	48	Now what else, you see any, other parts of his body?	
12	48		Yes
12	48	Oh, wow. Oh so that's an edge piece so this must be in the corner, huh?	
12	48		Da-
12	48		Yeah
12	48		
12	48		This is part of it
12	48	Oh, nice work	
12	48		
12	48		###
12	48	Do you see the corner piece anywhere?	
12	48		Hmm, it's going to be hard to find, because it's black and orange. Oh, I found it
12	48	Oh	
12	48		
12	48	Oh another edge piece	
12	48		Oh
12	48	But did li- Doesn't the corner piece need some pink?	
12	48		Oh I found it
12	48		This
12	48	### that's gonna work	
12	48		It's kinda tricky to put in
12	48		
12	48	Alright	
12	48	Aah, let's see. Any other parts of this flower? This orange flower	
12	48		Yes, right here

12	48		I don't know
12	48	*laughing* What should we do next? We can continue, see if there's more mushrooms, or-	
12	48		
12	48	We can find the rest of the snake	
12	48		Let's find the rest of the snake
12	48	Okay, that's a good idea	
12	48		There's lots of green. We have-
12	48	There is a lot of green, yeah	
12	48		Yeah we have to look carefully
12	48		I found one!

13	48	Check out, this piece, in the colors, and the colors on that piece that you just- that you have up there, do you think they go together?	
13	48		No
13	48		Does it go down here?

13	48	Good job	
13	48	Alright, what should we do next, More edges?	
13	48	Do you want more edges? Or do you want to finish off-	
13	48		Mmm
13	48		Mmm
13	48	Take a look at the- You almost got it	
13	48		Mmm
13	48	You know what? This one, might not fit yet. Maybe this is the second eye	
13	48		Hmm
13	48	Let's find pieces of this guys face. What do you think of that. Is that a good idea?	
13	48		Mm-hmm
13	48	Do you see any others? With his face and his eyes?	
13	48		*gasp*
13	48		
13	48	Cool	
13	48	Now that one fits, huh?	
13	48		
13	48		It fits right here
13	48	It does fit right there, you're right. How about any more of his face? Maybe a little bit of his nose?	
13	48	####	
13	48		Here
13	48	I think you're right	
13	48		
13	48	####	
13	48	Should we get more of that guy's face?	
13	48	Is there any more? Of his spots?

13	48	Shape is right, but, color's ####	
13	48	Where else can we try?	
13	48		
13	48	Yeah, hmm It looks like it wants to go there, but look the colors don't match up. Where else, Where else can we try? 	
13	48	I think that's a good idea	
13	48	####	
13	48		
13	48	There ya go, ### if we got a little bit more of him. Should we try to find him? More of his spots?	
13	48	Hmm	
13	48		*gasp* a little bit of his spots
13	48	That's right	
13	48		It goes right here?
13	48	Does it?	
13	48		Nope
13	48	Nope	
13	48	You were almost- Wait, wait, take a look	
13	48	You were almost there. You tried all these- No these are right, these are right,  you tried all of these, you got to here. Did you keep going?	
13	48		Mmm
13	48	There's one spot you didn't try, Nope, over here, wait, I think over here

13	48		It's right...
13	48		It's right
13	48	I think it's gonna- Yep	
13	48		Here
13	48		
13	48	Good job	
13	48	Alright, we got that guy. Now what do we want to do?	
13	48		####
13	48		The ant!
13	48	You wanna do this edge?	
13	48		No the ant
13	48	Then end? The ant? Do you know where the ant goes?	
13	48		Oh, right
13	48	Oh!	
13	48		Ah
13	48	You do	
13	48	mm-hmm	
13	48		
13	48	Alright	
13	48	How about this edge here? It looks like it's green and red	
13	48	You need an edge piece, with some green and some red, that's green and red	
13	48	Hmm, It doesn't look like that one is the one that fits but let's put this off, look let's find some more pieces with edge, and green and red	
13	48		Green and red. This one?
13	48	Green and red	
13	48	Is that an edge?	
13	48	Take a look, does that have an edge?	
13	48	Mmkay, these don't fit right now. Let's try again with another one. How about an edge piece with green leaf?	
13	48		
13	48	####	
13	48	Good job	
13	48		But there is the frogs
13	48	Yeah, it's a frog? That might be a snake	
13	48		Ah
13	48	I think he kinda looks like maybe a snake	
13	48		Where's the snake?
13	48	You wanna do that snake?	
13	48	You wanna work on that snake? You could do that	
13	48	This the one you going for?	
13	48	Look at his face	
13	48	Take a look, does that have an edge?	
13	48	So it has to go along the edge? Yep	
13	48		
13	48		Yeah
13	48	Alright	
13	48	What part next?	
13	48		####
13	48	What are you looking for? More snake?	
13	48		A s-
13	48		For another snake
13	48	Okay	
13	48	Take a look at that edge	
13	48		Mmm
13	48	It's got an edge, right?	
13	48		*noises* And it goes like
13	48	Hmm no	
13	48		This?
13	48	Hmmm not there, 'cause look at the colors for this one	
13	48	It might go there, we'll check it out later, Alright. This piece, I was just gonna ask about this piece	
13	48		
13	48		
13	48	And you grabbed it	
13	48	Does that fit? Nope. Okay let's wait on that one	
13	48	Let's wait on this. I don't think it fits there, NAME	
13	48	'Cause we need something with darker green that's got ####	
13	48		Dark and green?
13	48	Darker green	
13	48		This one?
13	48	It is darker green. Alright. What- What else do you think this, corner piece is?	
13	48		It, This!
13	48	####	
13	48		Aah, This right here. Fits right here!
13	48	Mmm I don't know about that. Well, try it out	
13	48	Alright. We need a corner up here	
13	48	Can you find a corner?	
13	48	That looks like a corner. Let's put that in, does it fit there?	
13	48		
13	48		Yes
13	48	It kinda looks like it might go. So I think we need a piece right here with an edge, and some red, and some green	
13	48	Let's take a look at the colors, hon	
13	48	Red, red, That one's got green. It needs an edge- So let's look at the edge pieces. That's an edge with red and green. You are right about that. It doesn't fit there, right?	
13	48		Green!
13	48		Right
13	48	I want bottom, give me more bottom down here. Thank you	
13	48		
13	48	Hey, There ya go!	
13	48	Now this one, is another edge piece, but it's gotta have red and green too	
13	48	Still need some, its needs some red in there	
13	48	I think that's the way to go	
13	48		
13	48		Has a snake too!
13	48	It does have a snake too, you're right!	
13	48	That go there?	
13	48		No
13	48	No, I don't think so either	
13	48	What do you think? What should we do next? Should we do the edges?	
13	48		This one goes right-
13	48	Does it?	
13	48		
13	48	It does	
13	48		It does
13	48	You're right	
13	48		Where's this one go? It goes right here?
13	48	That looks like it does. Do you wanna do the one that goes next to it? More brown?	
13	48		
13	48		This one?
13	48	I don't know. Does it look-	
13	48		#### goes up?
13	48	I don't know, we'll have to- We'll see when we get there	
13	48	You wanna get more of the ant?	
13	48		*gasp* yeah!
13	48	Hmm, It's kinda similar colors	
13	48		What does that-
13	48	Okay, let's just see, More and, Look at more ant	
13	48	Do you see some pieces of the ants?	
13	48		Ah
13	48	Yep, yep	
13	48	Yep yep yep	
13	48	Hmm	
13	48	That's one way. Is there another way to go?	
13	48	Can we turn it? See if it fits a little better a different way?	
13	48		
13	48	Cool	
13	48		
13	48	Good job. We need a- I think we need an edge piece here, some of the- little bit of the ant	
13	48		Ant ant ant mm mm
13	48	Hmm	
13	48	Oh, I think it's hard to see, 'Cause I think it's got red in it	
13	48		Red
13	48	Mm-hmm	
13	48		#### red
13	48		####
13	48	Let- You know what you- Bottom down, honey. Thank you. I'll move the pieces closer to you	
13	48	Okay we need some- We need some edges with red and green	
13	48		mm
13	48		hmm
13	48	okay, what are we gonna ####	
13	48		This one

13	48	I think it- Yes. Does that fit there? Almost	
13	48		Mmm
13	48		Mmm
13	48	Well that needs to be a corner, right?	
13	48	Could try that	
13	48	How about a corner with some red and some green?	
13	48	I think- Lookit- Woo! Okay, let's try to find this piece here	
13	48		
13	48	Let's get these edges, Let's all- Let's line up our edges, can you help me find the edges?	
13	48		*noises*
13	48	Let's li- Let's get all our edges done here	
13	48		This one
13	48	I think there's some more edges	
13	48	Hey bud? Let's do this	
13	48		What
13	48	Let's take- Let's line up all our edges, let's take care of all our edges. Can you find any more edges up here?	
13	48		*sounds*
13	48	 Is that an edge piece?	
13	48	No	
13	48		Yeah it is. It has a edge like this, and a edge like this, and a edge like this, and a- All the edges!
13	48	Can we - We gotta find one with an edge	
13	48	*laughing*	
13	48	Yeah, that's true, but let's find one with a whole side as an edge	
13	48		Oh! It's me! *singing* Na-na-na-na-na-na *noises*
13	48	Yep, here's- This is what I mean by an edge. This whole side is an edge. Let's put that there	
13	48	#### Here ya go	
13	48	Now, of all these edge pieces, let's find one- What else you put together? Good	
13	48		Where's it go?
13	48	I don't know	
13	48	Let's just put it down	
13	48	I don't know. We'll figure that out. But hey, Let's find the edge piece that looks like it would go here	
13	48		Ah
13	48	Let's- These are your edge pieces	
13	48		Where's a dirty one?
13	48	Hmm?	
13	48	Where's what?	
13	48		Where's- Where the dirty this?
13	48	Dirty like that? I don't know, might not have any-	
13	48		Where's a dirty-
13	48		Path
13	48	Yeah I don't know if it's got the dirty path on there. It might- The dirty path might end here	
13	48		He's trying ####
13	48	That one, follow that one	
13	48		This is for the ant
13	48	These are all your edge pieces, buddy, #### you move 'em down here	
13	48		*noises*
13	48	How about, let's, I got an idea, why don't I try this one	
13	48		
13	48		
13	48		It fits!
13	48	It does fit, so now we-	
13	48		And it #### me!
13	48	That one looks like you, huh?	
13	48		Yeah
13	48	Mm-hmm	
13	48		####
13	48	Hmm? Doesn't have an edge	
13	48	Hey, look, we need a corner. Two edges that have some red and green	
13	48		E- This one is called #### me, but I #### the other one of me
13	48	But it has an edge here	
13	48	We need a corner. It's got red, and green. Right there	
13	48		Mmm
13	48	You find it, Yeah	
13	48		
13	48	Now we need another edge, that's got red, and green	
13	48		Mmm
13	48	Alright, we just gotta get this one done, huh?	
13	48	That doesn't go there. It must go up here somewhere, right? It doesn't go there	
13	48	Hmm. I think you tried all the ways. So it's gonna go up here somewhere	
13	48	Alright, let's figure this one out, huh?	
13	48	Where do you think this one might go?	
13	48		Right here
13	48	Should we try it?	
13	48		
13	48		Mmm
13	48	Good job	
13	48	So, what else ####

13	48	Here's another corner. Should I put the corner in?	
13	48		Mmm
13	48		
13	48	Okay	
13	48	So	
13	48	What else do we wanna do here?	
13	48	Alright NAME, come look at the puzzle

13	48		We'll do this ####
13	48	You're gonna look for that one? Okay	
13	48		That needs, it needs ####
13	48	So it needs some green and some pink and some orange, and it's an edge

13	48	Oh, you're right!	
13	48		That- That's a little, part of the snake!
13	48	That is a little part of the snake. So we got two more edge pieces up here	
13	48		
13	48	'Kay. We've got one last edge piece to fit in, One last edge piece to find	
13	48		It's this one?
13	48	Nah	
13	48		No
13	48	No	
13	48		This one?

15	24		
15	24	*laughing*	
15	24		I want that one
15	24	Okay, so how we gonna do this one?	
15	24		
15	24	Together	
15	24		Put these pieces
15	24	Well, NAME, how 'bout we do the pieces that are straight first, and we build from the outside, 'member like we do at home? and we go from the inside	
15	24		It goes
15	24	Like what?	
15	24		I know
15	24	Well how 'bout we do this one? Like this? You think this goes... which way?	
15	24		I know
15	24		This way
15	24	You think so? Okay, let's try that. Put it there, let's try	
15	24	Well no it's straight. Remember we gotta do straight against the straight?	
15	24	'Kay, let's try that, and then *gasp* Ooh, ooh, do you think this one goes with that one? 'Cause it's yellow and and yellow? Lookit, yellow, yellow, straight, straight, you think it goes together?	
15	24	Oh, it does go together	
15	24	'Kay	
15	24		It goes-
15	24	But, I think a seahorse, doesn't it go this way? Or does it go this way?	
15	24	That's a seahorse, right? You think it goes that way?	
15	24		
15	24		It goes like this
15	24	Okay	
15	24		It goes like that
15	24	Okay if you wanna try it like that	
15	24	Now which one, which one do you think now? Oh-	
15	24		###
15	24		A chair
15	24	Okay	
15	24	Let's get closer together	
15	24		###
15	24	Watch your feet	
15	24	How 'bout, how 'bout corner pieces? These pieces go in the corner, look at, 'cause they're corner pieces	
15	24		That piece...
15	24	I think it goes up here, I think so	
15	24		Ooh
15	24	Ooh, NAME, look at that, pink and pink, I think, if you put it in the corner-	
15	24	Yeah, NAME, that's it, but because it's a corner piece I think it goes like this, I, NAME look	
15	24		
15	24	I think it goes like this what do you think?	
15	24	I think so NAME, *gasp* Ooh, NAME you're getting it, what other pink pieces are there?	
15	24		
15	24	'Kay, You're right, Okay, That's right, You did it	
15	24		
15	24	Now which one? There was an eye, I wonder if we could find another part of the eye and it has to be a corner piece. Ooh-	
15	24		It's a shark
15	24		
15	24	I think so I think you're right	
15	24	Ah, I don't think so, 'cause is there anything that looks like this in this picture right here? Not that one	
15	24	I don't think that goes	
15	24		Umm
15	24	Let's try another color	
15	24		Where this ###
15	24	Can I tell you something? I think it has to be straight 'cause this is straight	
15	24		It's supposed to go
15	24	How 'bout this one?	
15	24		I already tried that piece
15	24	Okay, so let's get another straight piece. You think it's this piece?	
15	24		Not fitting!
15	24	Okay, don't get mad, so let's try another straight piece. Umm, this piece?	
15	24		Not fitting!
15	24	Okay	
15	24	Okay, *gasp* I know, how 'bout this piece?	
15	24		
15	24	I think that one fits *gasp* I think you got it	
15	24		
15	24	Lookit I think that's a whale. Do you think it's a whale or do you think it's a shark?	
15	24		I think it's a shark
15	24	I think it's a whale. I wonder # 	
15	24		### find out
15	24		Maybe ###
15	24	That's a straight piece	
15	24	So straight pieces go along this way	
15	24	###	
15	24	I don't think it goes there. I think we need blue for that blue	
15	24	I don't think it's that, Ooh is it that blue? I don't think so, NAME you know why? Lookit right here, it doesn't fit. Maybe this is the piece though. I think actually you're right. You know why? Look at this. This is the fin, and then this is the purple part	
15	24		
15	24	But, this is all straight, we all have to find straight pieces or corner pieces that go there	
15	24	So these aren't straight, this isn't straight	
15	24	How bout this one, this one's a straight one	
15	24		Oh yeah
15	24		These pieces are straight!
15	24	You know what we'll do? We'll separate the straight pieces so we can make- oh, here, let me ###	
15	24	you sit	
15	24	Okay	
15	24		Put me more closer
15	24	Okay	
15	24	Let's get the straight pieces first	
15	24	Let's put all the other pieces away so that this can help us	
15	24	This is a straight piece, this is a straight piece, straight piece, straight piece, corner piece, straight piece, straight piece, corner, straight	
15	24	This is not	
15	24		Maybe, it go right here
15	24		Maybe try to...
15	24	Maybe that one, 'cause it's orange, goes over here by itself 'cause there's nothing else that's orange right now	
15	24	Let's try and leave it there and see what happens	
15	24		This is orange
15	24	Okay	
15	24	It's straight though, so I think it either goes here or here	
15	24		
15	24		Find out
15	24	Okay, let's see	
15	24		Find out!
15	24	Ooh, I think you're doing it	
15	24		Find out
15	24	I think you're doing it NAME	
15	24		Find out
15	24	How about NAME can I show you something?	
15	24	I think this is a- a corner piece, look at, 'cause it's gotta be two straight pieces right here, one piece, two piece, I think maybe this one goes there	
15	24	But you can try it- you can tell Mommy	
15	24	I think you're doing it, and then you go right there, okay, so	
15	24		Aww, we forgot a piece
15	24	We did?	
15	24		Yeah
15	24		Oh yeah
15	24	What piece do you think we forgot?	
15	24		It's supposed to be ###
15	24	You think, is this one here?	
15	24	There you go	
15	24	Did we put the wrong piece in there?	
15	24	Don't get mad	
15	24		I'm not getting-
15	24	Aah, did we maybe put the wrong piece- Let's see	
15	24		
15	24	Put that there, let's try something	
15	24	Oh, I think that one goes there	
15	24		
15	24		Now we're connecting it
15	24	Okay how about this one? This one, orange and brown, that's straight, that goes there	
15	24		
15	24		It's connects!
15	24	Okay, Ooh, How about this one in the corner, I think it goes in the corner, I think if you t- no this one here, in this corner, 'cause it's got two straight pieces, that's that doesn't have two straight pieces	
15	24		Maybe this piece
15	24		
15	24	Oh that's right, you did it	
15	24		
15	24		*noises*
15	24	You did it again! I think we got one more straight piece to put, and then we can put the middle inside	
15	24		
15	24	Okay, Now, let's see where our colors are, we have orange, purple, blue, blue	
15	24		This is ###-
15	24		You said this was blue
15	24	No, this is orange, I think orange goes over here, NAME, and purple	
15	24		Oh it's not fitting
15	24	Not fitting?	
15	24	Can I see something? Let me see if this one fits. Can I see if this one fits?	
15	24	Mm	
15	24		
15	24	I think that one fits, because it's purple and orange, that piece had purple in it, and this has orange in it and so does that and that fits, that's right	
15	24	And, are you sure that one goes there?	
15	24		Sure this one goes there?
15	24	I don't think so	
15	24		Oh, this one goes right here?
15	24	I don't think so 'cause you have to put it with the- Ooh there you go	
15	24		
15	24		
15	24	Wow, and how 'bout this piece here?	
15	24	Well there's no orange over here, NAME	
15	24	Think there's orange over here though	
15	24		
15	24	Oh you did it	
15	24		Almost done
15	24	Mm-hmm you're almost done, NAME	
15	24		And then we're doing a different puzzle
15	24	I think so, I think they have us doing one more puzzle	
15	24	Uhh, where does this one go, NAME?	
15	24		I know where this one goes
15	24		
15	24	Oh my god, you do know where that goes	
15	24		*noises*
15	24	And where do you think that one goes?	
15	24	Do you wanna turn it around? I think was- well it- It's a shark, so i- I think that's part of the shark's eye, that's his yellow, and there's yellow, so I think you have to turn it around	
15	24		Like this?
15	24	I think so, You can try it and see if it happens. Oh, I think you're right, and this one?	
15	24		
15	24		And then last piece we'll do
15	24		
15	24		
15	24	*gasp* Go tell them that you're done, go open the door and say "I'm done"	
15	24		Ooh!
15	24	Go tell 'em you're done	
15	24		
15	24	This is it? Okay, come on	
15	24	Let's look at this one, what is this? Let's look at it before we take it apart, what is that?	
15	48		
15	48	It's a jungle, It's sort of like the rainforest cafe. Okay, so, we have to do it	
15	48	Let's make it a mess	
15	48		These are so little pieces
15	48	Oh my goodness. Do you think we're gonna do it or do you think it's gonna be too hard?	
15	48		Oops, ### we dropped a piece
15	48	That's okay	
15	48	Okay	
15	48	Okay	
15	48	This one might be a little bit harder, NAME, so we have to turn them around, turn all the pieces around, separate them	
15	48	We gotta do all the straight pieces first, right?	
15	48	Okay, so NAME?	
15	48	Do you want me to take out the straight pieces for you first?	
15	48		Yeah
15	48	Okay	
15	48		This is a colorful butterfly
15	48		### know how ###
15	48	These are all the straight pieces	
15	48		
15	48		###
15	48	Let's do all the straight pieces first	
15	48		butterfly ###
15	48	You think you got it?	
15	48		I think I got it
15	48		Nope
15	48	No?	
15	48		Because
15	48		Maybe this piece is the wrong piece
15	48	I don't think, that piece doesn't work, because, well but you know what? Let's let's do the other-	
15	48	Let's do the square pieces first, the ones that have straight lines, and then we'll put everything in the inside	
15	48	Isn't that how you do it? That's how we do it at home, with Daddy	
15	48	Okay	
15	48	That's a straight piece, that's a straight piece, that's a straight piece	
15	48	And that's a straight piece, that's a straight piece	
15	48		This goes in-
15	48	Okay	
15	48	So NAME, let's do all the straight pieces first	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	so NAME	
15	48	Which four pieces have corners in them?	
15	48	There's four pieces that have corners in 'em. Can you find them for mom?	
15	48	We can put these in the corners. Look at this one, where do you think he goes?	
15	48		###
15	48		He goes...
15	48	You think he goes there? Or you think he goes all the way over there?	
15	48	### Yeah I think you're right	
15	48	Did we drop some pieces?	
15	48	Okay	
15	48		I- I was gonna get it
15	48	Oh I'm sorry	
15	48		Okay
15	48	'Kay, come on. Get closer	
15	48	Okay	
15	48	Let's do the- Let's do the straight pieces first, look at this piece, it's not straight, we gotta do all the border first, this is called a border	
15	48	So let's put this over here. So what other straight piece, what- what other one has a corner like this one does?	
15	48		Nope
15	48		
15	48	Oh be careful! Here, wait wait wait, don't roll over me	
15	48	Lookit this one has a corner. You think this one goes here?	
15	48	I think that one goes there. So where's the other part of the butterfly?	
15	48	You can build on the butterfly	
15	48	You have to do it straight	
15	48	Straight, straight, see how you have to, you turn it around	
15	48	See the green? and green	
15	48	Think if you turn it around it will fit	
15	48	Yep, there you go	
15	48	Do you need help to get back up again? Here	
15	48		Aw you hurted me
15	48	Sorry	
15	48		I think this is ### piece. Nope
15	48	Mmm no, how 'bout you try on this side?	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	Straight, straight. I think if you turn it around...	
15	48	No	
15	48	I think it you turn it around this way	
15	48	That's right	
15	48	See? That works	
15	48	And do we have another piece? NAME do we have another piece that looks like a butterfly piece?	
15	48		I pushed it
15	48		Yeah
15	48	'Kay which piece do we have that looks like a butterfly piece?	
15	48	'Member, it either goes here or here, 'cause we're building the border first	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	There we go, how about this piece? Where do we think this piece goes, NAME?	
15	48		###
15	48	Are you sure?	
15	48		Now it looks like it done
15	48	'Kay, so what- what's	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	How 'bout we build, where's another corner piece so that it can help you? Ooh no, this is a corner piece, where do you think that corner piece goes? It's either gonna go in this corner or that corner, 'cause it's a corner piece	
15	48		*noises*
15	48		*noises*
15	48		###
15	48		It goes right h- right-
15	48		
15	48	No it's a corner piece, it goes in the corner, NAME	
15	48		Maybe try like this
15	48	Lookit I think this one goes here, Lookit, NAME	
15	48	And I think this one goes, lookit, because it's got, lookit, one straight side, two straight sides. Let's try this one. See how it fits right in there?	
15	48	Oop- Okay	
15	48	Let's put all the other straight pieces all across the border	
15	48	Okay so where do you think this one goes?	
15	48		Nope
15	48	No?	
15	48		### like
15	48	I don't think so, 'cause lookit, that one has orange in it, and that doesn't have orange. It has green and red in it	
15	48		This is not green. This- this is not red this- this is pink
15	48	How about...	
15	48	You try this piece in there	
15	48	### put back in the corn, hon	
15	48		This piece is super easy
15	48	Yeah?	
15	48	You think so?	
15	48	I don't know if it's super easy, but how 'bout you try this piece, NAME. Look at this one	
15	48	Okay, that's right, and then...	
15	48	This one here has pink flower in it, look at this one. Can I show you something? This has pink in it, I think this has pink in it, so I think if you put it beside it might work	
15	48	Yeah, it does work, okay, so	
15	48		No
15	48	Nope, let's see, NAME?	
15	48		What
15	48	Let's see if this, umm, Do you think this piece works? Over here if you try it?	
15	48	I would- I think it fits up here	
15	48	I think this piece fits right here	
15	48	If you can try and see	
15	48	It does fit, NAME	
15	48	It does fit, okay so let's see what other flowers we have. Let me see?	
15	48	They're a little red flower there. Maybe this is it, right here	
15	48	Can you try it and see if it works for mom?	
15	48	Ooh you did it! You're doing such a good job. Ooh okay how 'bout this one?	
15	48		###
15	48	Lookit, has orange	
15	48	'Kay, what other color does this have? What color do you think this one goes?	
15	48	Which piece do you think goes there?	
15	48		### Ooh yeah!
15	48	You think this piece goes there?	
15	48	'Cause it got orange? But that doesn't have a straight piece so I think that goes over there	
15	48	There we go, there we go NAME	
15	48		And then we're connecting its
15	48	We are connecting them, but we have to find some more straight pieces, right?	
15	48	Okay, so NAME, so what piece do you think goes right... here?	
15	48	What piece- Where does that piece go, you think	
15	48		I...
15	48	That's a straight piece, though	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	Ooh NAME, you wanna try this piece in there?	
15	48	I think it goes over here	
15	48		Like this?
15	48	No... I guess not	
15	48		Like this?
15	48	Nope	
15	48	I don't think it goes with that yet, 'cause we have to find something that has a pink flower in it	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	'Kay, and what goes that one?	
15	48	These are all the straight pieces, so you work on straight pieces, I think we're missing some straight pieces	
15	48		Missing some
15	48	There's a straight piece	
15	48		The pink piece
15	48	That's a straight piece	
15	48	'Kay I think that's really it	
15	48	So let's try	
15	48	So what goes right here?	
15	48		I think it's
15	48	You didn't drop any, did you?	
15	48		
15	48	I don't think so	
15	48	I didn't see you drop any	
15	48		I think we throwed them in the garbage
15	48	Oh NAME I think I found a piece	
15	48	I think if you put that one there, I think this one fits right there	
15	48	Yep, it does work, NAME, Okay	
15	48	So, NAME, Where do you think this piece goes?	
15	48		What?
15	48		Goes nowhere, except here
15	48	I don't think so, that doesn't have orange or green in that color	
15	48	We can't push it 'cause it doesn't fit in there	
15	48	Maybe this one fits in there?	
15	48		That fits
15	48	No, this one-	
15	48	No	
15	48	I think these ones go up here	
15	48	How bout this part over here, can I try something? Let me see	
15	48	Does that work in there? No, that doesn't work in there. That's not right. Here let me get it	
15	48		You're making it break
15	48	Okay	
15	48		You're making it get breaked
15	48	gonna make it break?	
15	48	###	
15	48		I think I got the right piece
15	48		Think this one
15	48	Lookit, NAME, I think I found it. Right there	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	And, we have one more piece, right here. It's kind of a small piece, let's see if we could find it. You wanna try this piece in there?	
15	48	No that doesn't work	
15	48	That doesn't work, oh-	
15	48	It has to be a piece, look at, that has two holes in it. Does this have two holes in it?	
15	48	Yeah but that's too big	
15	48	Does this have two holes in it?	
15	48	How 'bout you try this one	
15	48	Does that work?	
15	48		Nope. Too, m- medium
15	48	Yeah, it's too medium?	
15	48		Too medium
15	48		too
15	48	It's too medium?	
15	48	And that's- Doesn't fit	
15	48	Hmm	
15	48		I wonder what piece that fits
15	48		What piece fits
15	48	I was wondering if we did a piece wrong	
15	48	Are you okay? Are you tired?	
15	48		Yes
15	48		Tired
15	48	Yeah	
15	48	Well, we have all these other pieces	
15	48	We still have to do all these other pieces	
15	48	Look at all these pieces here	
15	48	Lookit, we'll put the tiger together, or leopard, I should say	
15	48	'cause he's got spots, so, uh, he goes together	
15	48		I never thought ###, I never ###
15	48		Maybe this right piece
15	48	Ooh NAME I think- I think this actually goes in there maybe	
15	48	Did you try that one?	
15	48		It's super... big
15	48		
15	48	Let me see? Here wait wait wait	
15	48		Super
15	48		Not fitting, making the puzzle break
15	48	Hmm	
15	48	Well, yeah #	
15	48	And then maybe this one just goes to here, Here put that down	
15	48	Put it down, NAME	
15	48		I can't
15	48	Why? I think this one, does it go? This one fits. Lookit, it fits. So you got it right, so just leave that there. And then maybe this one?	
15	48	Or	
15	48	Maybe we did something wrong. What do you think?	
15	48	Hmm?	
15	48	Maybe...	
15	48	I don't think we did anything wrong, I don't know	
15	48	Oh, careful. I don't want you to fall down. Come here	
15	48	'Kay	
15	48		This is a straight piece
15	48	Hmm?	
15	48	Mmm I don't think that goes there	
15	48		Try this way
15	48	Which one?	
15	48	Can I show you something?	
15	48		Try in this, try like this
15	48	but that's-	
15	48		Try
15	48		*noises*
15	48	'Kay	
15	48		
15	48	Can we try again? Let- 'Kay let's put these pieces here	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	And, where do you think this piece goes here?	
15	48	It's should go up here, because that's straight. That doesn't fit in there we tried it already.	
15	48	And how 'bout this one here?	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	There we go	
15	48	And how 'bout we build...	
15	48	That doesn't go there. Does this go here?	
15	48	No	
15	48	How bout'...	
15	48		We need something
15	48	We do need something? What do we need?	
15	48	What do we need, buddy?	
15	48		I don't know
15	48	You don't know? These are t- This isn't straight	
15	48		These pieces are so small
15	48		You can never find these pieces
15	48	What pieces?	
15	48	Well, I don't know where this one goes, 'cause we have to have- put this with the animals	
15	48	you want us to build- building the tiger?	
15	48	Here, let's start building the tiger together	
15	48	Let's put him in the middle	
15	48		I think it does connect
15	48	Well no his eyes have to go the same	
15	48		
15	48	*laughing* NAME we're not almost done, silly-billy	
15	48		
15	48	Here, lookit, let's do the tiger eyes, right here	
15	48		I got it together!
15	48	Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait	
15	48	Lookit, eye here	
15	48	Let's see, well she wants us to hurry up, oop- Come here. Put that one there! Lookit, lookit this watch this, watch this, *noises* bingo!	
15	48	*noises* bingo	
15	48	Okay, oh you know what h- might have happened, I think the butterfly goes-	
15	48	Look at this, butterfly-	
15	48	it might go the other way, NAME	
15	48	So we might have done this the wrong way somehow	
15	48	Look at this, leave the tiger in the middle, but somehow-	
15	48	Look at this, okay	
15	48	Is there another part of the tiger? Here's another part of the tiger	
15	48	Where do you think he goes, here? Look at this	
15	48	Ooh, I think he goes there. And then, what about this one?	
15	48		I think- You did the wrong piece
15	48	No I didn't, lookit	
15	48	I think, somehow, you and I did it wrong	
15	48	'cause look at the tiger's- right here	
15	48	What's wrong?	
15	48		It's taking for a long time
15	48	*laughing* it's taking too long for you?	
15	48	Are you mad now?	
15	48	Are you mad because it's taking too long?	
15	48		Yeah
15	48	It's okay	
15	48	Aren't you having fun with me anymore?	
15	48	Oh but this one-	
15	48	Where does this one go?	
15	48	You can help me with that one	
15	48		This is not a tiger it's a cheetah
15	48	Right, it's a cheetah. Where does that go?	
15	48	I think 'cause he's got dots it goes the other way	
15	48	Yeah, I think so	
15	48	And this one might be finishing, let me see?	
15	48	Does that finish his head?	
15	48	I think so

15	48		I got it
15	48	That's not straight though	
15	48	I don't think that's the right piece	
15	48	It's gotta be straight	
15	48	Look at, this it? No	
15	48	You got to get the straight piece, NAME

15	48	Lookit, where is this leaf?	
15	48		Two more days
15	48	It's straight, it's a straight piece. NAME, it's a straight piece, it either goes here or here	
15	48	NAME	
15	48		Maybe it goes like this
15	48		
15	48		Push it! It's fitting but it's not going down
15	48		
15	48	N- No, because it's straight, it goes up here, NAME, you're not getting it right, honey	
15	48		
15	48		
15	48	'Member, we gotta do straight and straight. And then what else?	
15	48		
15	48	How many more straight pieces are there?	
15	48	There's another straight piece	
15	48		
15	48		And it's not fitting
15	48	### 'Kay, how bout this one? And then I think you're finished with all the straight pieces	
15	48		
15	48		Not
15	48	Okay, and look at this piece. No no no we're not done yet	
15	48		I'm just telling her
15	48		
15	48	No you're not telling her 'cause we're not done. You can't tell her anything until we're finished	
15	48		I'm just telling her we're almost done

15	48	Almost, come on NAME	
15	48		
15	48	But we're not done yet so we have to finish. You can't call her until you're done	
15	48		
15	48	How 'bout this one, where does this one go?	
15	48		
15	48		Where this piece goes
15	48	You think it goes there? I don't think so	
15	48	I don't think it goes there	
15	48	Lookit	
15	48	There's brown and brown, which pieces are brown?	
15	48	How 'bout you do the red pieces? 'Cause there's some red pieces over here and some red pieces over here	
15	48	And, the tiger is right there, or the cheetah, I should say, so where do you think he goes? Lookit right here	
15	48	Here's part of the cheetah, where do you think he goes?	
15	48		
15	48	Mmkay	
15	48	And where do you think that goes?	
15	48		
15	48	Okay, so, we're almost done, now lookit, no no no come on, let's finish it so you can run on out and tell her that you're done	
15	48		Just telling her
15	48	You got four more pieces	
15	48		We're almost done!
15	48	*laughing* Oh NAME, we're not done	
15	48		We're almost done
15	48	But we're not done. Lookit, where do you think this piece goes?	
15	48		I'm just kidding
15	48	*noises* you're gonna fall down	
15	48	No no no, it's gonna break. It's gonna break and we're gonna have to start all over	
15	48	Where does this piece go? Lookit here, lookit this piece	
15	48	Lookit right here, can I show you something?	
15	48	Here, here, look at this	
15	48		
15	48	'Kay	
15	48		
15	48	'Kay, and then we got three more pieces so let's see if you know where they go	
15	48	I don't think so, NAME	
15	48	Look at the leaf right here, can I show you something?	
15	48		What?
15	48	Lookit, it goes this way. See the little red right there? See that there's a little bit of red, what do you think?	
15	48		
15	48	There you go	
15	48	And then there's two more pieces do you know where the two more pieces go so you can go and tell her you're done?	
15	48		
15	48	Mm-hmm	
15	48	Now where does that piece go?	
15	48		This is going...
15	48		###
15	48	I think it goes the other way	
15	48		I think we did it
15	48	No I think you need to turn it around	
15	48		*noises*
15	48	I think it goes this way	
15	48		
15	48	Now you can go and tell her that you're done	
15	48		
15	48		
15	48	Yep	
15	48	You gonna go play with her?	
15	48		###
15	48	Did you ask her what-	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
16	48	Okay	
16	48	So we look at it	
16	48		
16	48		
16	48	And then let's take it all apart and we'll put it all back together. Ready?	
16	48		'Kay
16	48	Demolition	
16	48		Explosion time
16	48	Ooh! Can we pick it all up? All at once? Woo!	
16	48		These are smaller p-
16	48	Is that the face of a sloth, you think?	
16	48		Yeah
16	48	###	
16	48	### can you take all of those apart ###?	
16	48		Hey, only one is together
16	48	And then, do you want to start with a specific animal and build the animal first, or do you want to do the outsides first?	
16	48		Let's do a s-
16	48	Should we do the border? Or should we s- Should we pick an animal and start with the animal?	
16	48		The
16	48		Pick a animal and start the animal. Let's do the #### the this one, this kind of animal first
16	48	Start from the inside	
16	48		
16	48	Okay	
16	48	What does that look like it is?	
16	48		Well let's see. It has a- two green eyes
16	48	And it has a nose *sniffing*	
16	48	Do you remember where he went?	
16	48		Across the hall
16	48	*laughing* No I mean the m- The puzzle. Do you remember where this animal went in the puzzle? Was he in a corner, was he on a side, was he at the top?	
16	48		Right, he was right over here
16	48	Okay so let's put him in place	
16	48		And he's, he's  only a head
16	48	So he has spots, right? I see some more pieces with spots. Does that look like part of a nose?	
16	48		Yeah, a part of his, His nose. Don't take it it's his nose. ###
16	48	Yeah	
16	48	Gather up the pieces with spots	
16	48		I got these, these ones
16	48		Mmm
16	48		These are, um
16	48	Okay, have we gotten all the ones with spots?	
16	48		No
16	48	Now do we have them all?	
16	48		Yes
16	48	Okay	
16	48		###
16	48	Okay	
16	48	Hmm	
16	48		No it does go-
16	48	Probably his eyes go above his nose somehow, don't you think?	
16	48		Yes
16	48	Yeah, probably	
16	48	Mm-hmm	
16	48	Hmm	
16	48		It's a big animal, he's really big, he's-
16	48	*laughing*	
16	48		It's r- It doesn't attach. This- The snake goes higher up
16	48		
16	48	Oh, I was wrong	
16	48	Hmm, I think it would need one of those...	
16	48	poker-outer pieces	
16	48	A-ha!	
16	48	Does that look like it's the jaguar's ear?	
16	48		It does look like
16	48	I think that might be his ear	
16	48	And that might be the other one	
16	48		I don't know
16	48	Hmm, maybe it goes a different way	
16	48		*noises*
16	48		It's so hard!
16	48	Maybe it goes this way	
16	48	No	
16	48	Maybe it goes like this, there's a little white there, maybe it goes like that?	
16	48		No
16	48	No	
16	48	Does the ear go like this?	
16	48	Hmm, no. I think we have to match up the spots	
16	48	Can you help me match up the spots?	
16	48		Mm-hmm
16	48	See, if he has an ear here and an ear there...	
16	48	Mm-hmm! Now we're just missing his other ear. Oop! I see a little piece with spots on it	
16	48		With spots on it
16	48		Now what- Ooh!
16	48	Hmm, and then what's gonna go down here?	
16	48	So let's keep that one over here since this one also has spots on it and maybe we'll figure out-	
16	48		Uh
16	48		
16	48	A butterfly	
16	48		I can't do this butterfly, this butterfly is-
16	48	I think we're gonna run out of room, maybe if we move him over a little bit	
16	48	We've got a bunch of butterfly pieces here. Ooh! This one's a straight edge, so that- It e- It either goes here, or here, don't you think? Do you think it goes down here, or over here?	
16	48		I think this might go over here, this has spots
16	48	Mm-hmm	
16	48		###
16	48	Does it fit there? Well this has a blade of green grass coming down	
16	48	There we go	
16	48		Looks a little bit like a monarch butter- butterfly
16	48	Hmm, like a monarch butterfly? I thought monarchs were orange and black	
16	48		Yes they are but these-
16	48	But we've seen butterflies that are- have that blue color at the butterfly museum, haven't we?	
16	48		Yeah, I have
16	48	I see little spots in there	
16	48		Let's go right here
16	48	Mm-hmm, we've almost got the butterfly all put together	
16	48	So #### got another piece here, and another piece here	
16	48	Ooh, and this piece. That looks like a corner	
16	48		Aah!
16	48	Hmm?	
16	48		This goes- This goes more down over here
16	48	You sure that this one fits here?	
16	48	It doesn't seem to fit very well. I think this one must not go here	
16	48		Yes it does, see?
16	48	But look at the little lines, they don't match up	
16	48	I don't know. We've got one other piece, why don't you try one- the other piece and see if it fits better than that one does	
16	48	That's a corner, we can zip it down	
16	48		
16	48		
16	48	There!	
16	48		*laughing*
16	48	This one still has the spots where do you think that one goes?	
16	48		Oh
16	48	Ooh, I think this is an ear here	
16	48		
16	48	Yeah	
16	48		Was he a ear here
16	48	Oh!	
16	48	Now he has his two ears and he can hear us	
16	48	Hello, Mr. Jaguar, how are you?	
16	48		Ow I ####
16	48	Hmm	
16	48		
16	48	There	
16	48	Alright, what's next? Should we do the snake? Or there's some sort of a plant over here?	
16	48		*noises*
16	48		There's, a frog is on
16	48	Huh	
16	48		Those go over there
16	48	Well here's another part of that plant	
16	48	And here's another part, now this has an edge	
16	48		Here's some more of, some more
16	48		####
16	48	Ooh I see some froggy toes like that over here with this piece. Maybe these are not too far away from each other. They also have similar stripes	
16	48	Mmm	
16	48	Since they- They aren't attached to anything yet they might be difficult to figure out	
16	48	But we know that those are froggy feet, right? So here's the frog	
16	48		This is the big frog and this is the little frog
16	48	Mm-hmm	
16	48		Mommy, I see a little f-
16	48		
16	48	### Oh there's more frog feet, how many frogs were there?	
16	48		Two
16	48	Maybe those are the toes that are missing, Mm-hmm	
16	48	We've reattached its toes	
16	48		His toes ####
16	48		####
16	48	There you go! Do a little surgery and get his toes back on	
16	48	There! Great	
16	48	Hmm	
16	48	Okay, so we've got froggy feet, we have a frog head-	
16	48	No, that doesn't go there	
16	48	Maybe these are in the way, put these over here, yeah?	
16	48		I think this goes right here
16	48		
16	48	Good eyes	
16	48		#### This-
16	48	This looks like this attaches right there	
16	48		
16	48		It does
16	48	Mm-hmm	
16	48	What's next?	
16	48		Here's this one is the one who's on it
16	48	Oh, well he's a corner, you see?	
16	48		He goes up here
16	48		
16	48	Okay	
16	48	Looks good to me	
16	48		*noises*
16	48	Almost	
16	48		
16	48	There!	
16	48		There
16	48	And...	
16	48		And, ta-da!
16	48		
16	48	*laughing*	
16	48	Da-dum	
16	48		And
16	48	Yeah, I bet that one goes up at the top	
16	48		ta-dum!
16	48		
16	48	*laughing* Great! Now we have this snake	
16	48		Let's, here's-
16	48	Is that part of his- Ooh I'm sorry, Is that part of his body?	
16	48		Yeah it is this ####
16	48	And then this would be another part	
16	48		
16	48		
16	48		*noises*
16	48	Ooh he's missing his eye, his other eye	
16	48	Can you see it anywhere?	
16	48	I think this is probably the sloth's hand, so that goes with the s- Oh and here's the other-	
16	48	I'd say those go together	
16	48	Where's the snake's eye?	
16	48	Hmm!	
16	48	Oh well, we'll find it	
16	48		Did it have an eye with ####
16	48	Well now I don't remember	
16	48	Perhaps something else is covering it up. We'll find out when we get to that piece	
16	48	Here's another corner. I bet this one goes down here	
16	48		Mommy
16	48	So then we just have one more corner to find	
16	48		This, this has to be right here
16	48		
16	48	### if we pick them up	
16	48	Mm-hmm	
16	48		There
16	48		
16	48	Well, what's next, how about these leaves, if we could fill in these, 'cause those-	
16	48	Are a pretty distinct pattern	
16	48		
16	48	There we go, finish off the ant	
16	48		
16	48	Were the ants close to each other?	
16	48		Yeah
16	48	Yeah	
16	48		Were- Were next
16	48		Were touching, were together
16	48	Ooh but they're leaf-cutter ants	
16	48		
16	48		What are leaf-cutter ants?
16	48	Well they cut the leaves, with their jaws, and they carry the leaves down into their, nest underground, and they grow a fungus on the leaves, and then they eat the fungus	
16	48		
16	48		Oh
16	48	Mm-hmm	
16	48		
16	48	Okay	
16	48	Well, let's see, it looks like maybe it- this kind of orange plant is starting over here so if we can figure out how these go-	
16	48		
16	48	This one doesn't look like an edge piece	
16	48	But this one looks like an edge piece	
16	48		This go right here, it goes right here
16	48	Mm-hmm	
16	48		
16	48		Mmm
16	48	There we go	
16	48	Can you fit that one in also?	
16	48		No
16	48	Hmm	
16	48	Well	
16	48	What if we gather up some more edge pieces and we complete the top	
16	48		There's also this-
16	48	Or we could complete the bottom	
16	48	Top or bottom?	
16	48		####
16	48		Bottom
16	48	Bottom it is	
16	48	*singing* The ants go marching one by one, I see little ant legs	
16	48	Here are more ant legs, Hoorah, Hoorah	
16	48		
16	48		Mmm mmm mmm
16	48	*singing* The ants go marching one by one the little one stops to suck his thumb and they all go marching down, to the ground, to get out, of the rain	
16	48		
16	48		
16	48	One more here- Aha!	
16	48	With the mushrooms on him, Mushrooms are a fungus	
16	48		
16	48	Okay	
16	48	Alright	
16	48	I think we need to try that one again, unless we're gonna just do the top row?	
16	48		
16	48	Okay, then let's look for the- Here's an edge piece, here's an edge piece, this one, this one	
16	48		The- These ones connect to- These ones connect together, look
16	48	Mm-hmm, where do you think that goes?	
16	48		Up in here?
16	48	Like so?	
16	48		So
16	48		
16	48		
16	48	We're really close	
16	48	So he's gonna take this puzzle, and he's gonna give us another one to work on	
16	48		This one was crazy
16	48	*laughing*	
16	48		It was lot of a lot-
16	48	We got almost all of it done	
16	48	Just a little more time and we would have finished	
16	48	One more, Okay?	
16	48	I think we did very well that one was a big one	
16	48	Ooh

16	24	What is this?	
16	24		A sea anemone
16	24	Yep	
16	24		A octopus, a shark
16	24	Alright

16	24		Take it apart
16	24	*laughing* take it apart and re-do it	
16	24	Woops	
16	24		*laughing*
16	24		###
16	24		*noises*
16	24		
16	24	*laughing* We dropped one	
16	24		*laughing*
16	24	*laughing* Where did it go? Woops!	
16	24		Under, under under, got it! Ta-dum!
16	24	Can you see it?	
16	24	Great! Great! Bring it on up here	
16	24		Whoa
16	24		I'm thirsty
16	24	Sure, go ahead	
16	24		*sigh*
16	24	*laughing*	
16	24	*laughing* you have- you have an orange ring on your upper lip *laughing*	
16	24		*laughing*
16	24	Okay, have a seat, let's do this puzzle	
16	24		I need something to wipe it
16	24	*laughing* Okay. Okay here we go	
16	24	Crabby legs, Crab crab crab crab crab crabby legs!	
16	24		
16	24	And then, crab claws! Yeah?	
16	24		Crab head
16	24	*laughing*	
16	24		*laughing*
16	24		no no no no
16	24	Hmm	
16	24		Crab crab crab!
16	24	Crab!	
16	24		Crab!
16	24		Crab
16	24	Crab! Here's his eye	
16	24		
16	24	There!	
16	24		Crab, crab crab crab
16	24	All we're missing is the crab body	
16	24		Crab crab crab crab
16	24	What part of him is this?	
16	24		Well, it's his top
16	24		*noises* This is his other eye
16	24	Oh, I see, yeah yeah, so you want his eye to be close here, but that doesn't seem to fit	
16	24	So what's another way?	
16	24		
16	24	There!	
16	24		crab crab crab crab crab
16	24	Okay!	
16	24		
16	24		Crab crab crab crab crab
16	24		
16	24	Anemonie?	
16	24		Sea anemone?
16	24	More anemone?	
16	24		More anemone?
16	24	What's the enemy of an anemone?	
16	24		Eh, I don't know
16	24	I think it's lurking right next to it	
16	24	We'll see when we get it put together	
16	24	This one has a flat edge	
16	24		It must go right there
16	24		
16	24	The enemy of an anenome	
16	24		It's a crab
16	24	*laughing* Maybe a crab, yeah I don't know, maybe	
16	24	With those big claws he'd be able to snip off the tentacles, huh?	
16	24		Well I think it's going to sting it
16	24		
16	24	I know that some snails eat sea anemones	
16	24		But anemone will eat its predators and the predators will eat it
16	24	Looks like a tentacle right there, But what about this starfish?	
16	24	Is that an enemy of the anemone?	
16	24	Look out, Mr. anemone, there's a starfish coming your way	
16	24		
16	24	Alright, what do you wanna do next? What's up here?	
16	24		Star-
16	24		#### The anemone ####
16	24	We have a blue tail, and we have some orange tentacles	
16	24		Octopus
16	24	Octopus, how many legs?	
16	24		
16	24		Eight legs
16	24	Eight legs	
16	24		Eight eight eight
16	24	Alright, so let's gather up the octopus pieces	
16	24		
16	24		Hmm hmm hmm hmm
16	24		
16	24	Nicely done!	
16	24		Hey Mommy, um, Anemones eat starfishes and crabs, and crabs eat anemones
16	24		See, anemone, eats this predator, and predators eat it. Well shark might eat him. But it'll sting the shark! *sounds*
16	24		
16	24	*laughing* that would hurt	
16	24	It might hurt enough to make the shark swim away, don't you think? Would you like to do the shark next?	
16	24		Yeah!
16	24		*noises* Yeah, and guard
16	24		
16	24	*sounds*	
16	24	*sounds*	
16	24		
16	24		*sounds*
16	24	*sounds*	
16	24		####
16	24	Mmm	
16	24	What part of the shark is that?	
16	24		
16	24		Umm, ####
16	24	It's his tail? Then that's his dorsal fin there	
16	24	Hmm	
16	24	What could be starting here?	
16	24		The swordfish?
16	24	Mm-hmm	
16	24		
16	24		There's swordfishes as big as sharks and shark and swordfish they attack
16	24		
16	24	I put a piece in	
16	24		And the swordfish might hit the shark a lot, like *sounds*
16	24		
16	24	Ouch	
16	24	Hmm	
16	24	Okay, so what goes over here?	
16	24		The anemone is about to sting, sting ####-
16	24		
16	24	There's a corner	
16	24		The anemone, is about to sting it
16	24	Look out crab!	
16	24		#### sting you
16	24	*laughing*	
16	24		Anemone stings its predators lots of times
16	24		If- Until it gets away
16	24	Mm-hmm	
16	24		And it-
16	24	It stings them enough that it stuns them, and then it pulls them in towards its mouth	
16	24	Works well with most fish, I think	
16	24	Anemones like to eat fish	
16	24		to eat fish
16	24		
16	24	Mm-hmm	
16	24		I got a , well
16	24		
16	24		'Cause I don't think ####
16	24		
16	24		A jellyfish won't try to eat a sea anemone, because a sea anemone will sting it!
16	24		
16	24	Yeah, what do you think would happen if a jellyfish floated by a sea anemone? Jellyfish have stinging tentacles, and anemones have stinging tentacles	
16	24		Wow
16	24	What would happen?	
16	24		Well, they might-
16	24	Do you think they wouldn't feel each other's stings, or do you think that they might have different kinds of stings?	
16	24		I think they have different kind of stings
16	24	Yeah, I don't know	
16	24	I don't know what would happen, if a jellyfish encountered a sea anemone	
16	24		This is ####-
16	24		
16	24	One last piece after this one	
16	24		
16	24	One last piece!	
16	24		
16	24		
16	24	Nice job	
16	24		Mommy
16	24	Do you wanna run across the hall and let them know that we finished the second puzzle?	
16	24		Yeah
16	24	We did that one quickly	
16	24		Mommy, and sea anemones, jellyfish and sea anemones...
16	24	Yep	
16	24		have stings which if they get stinged enough, it- The thing will die, or maybe-
16	24	At least paralyzed, I would think	
16	24		Yeah
16	24	So it can't move	
16	24	And it can't swim away	
16	24	Because jellyfish, they don't move very fast, they just bob around, and sea anemones, they're fixed in one spot	
16	24	So I think they they don't want their prey to be able to get away, because they wouldn't be able to chase it	
16	24	So they hunt in a different way	
16	24		To sting it! *sounds*
16	24	Yeah	
16	24		Dead. So, so
16	24		They will just be bobbing around
16	24	*sounds*	
16	24		And won't know this, a sea anemone going to attack it
16	24	*sounds*	
16	24		*sounds*
16	24	*laughing*	
16	24	Right? It looks so inviting, it's this pretty flower-looking thing, they fish just swims up, thinking it's going to be a nice place to hang out	
16	24		Well, a jellyfish
16	24	Bad luck for the fish, good luck for the anemone!	
16	24		Well
16	24		Like, this'll just be bobbing around, and this kind of animal can splash himself away with his tentacles
16	24	Yeah, they- they- Their big top is in the shape of a bell and the squeeze the bell and they *sounds* swim around like that *sounds*	
16	24		A- And some sea anemones can, can swim around
16	24	I don't think so, I think that they are attached, to, usually coral	
16	24		Well, they have little sticky suction cup feet
16	24	You're thinking of something else, what are you think- You're thinking of... Scallops!	
16	24	Scallops	
16	24	Can detach and push themselves around with their foot, can't they?	
16	24		Yeah
16	24	O- or they, or they, they can swim by opening and closing their shell	
16	24		Yes ###
16	24	Yeah, sea scallops	
16	24		And, sea anemones can move also
16	24		They o- They're, they're
16	24	Yeah I don't know. We should look it up again in the magazine that we got all about sea anemones	
16	24		They're they're let go, and float away, and they're direction their self with their tentacles
16	24	Oh, see I thought that that was the sea scallops. We can look it up	
16	24	We'll find out for sure	
16	24	We have that magazine that's all about- We have one that's all about sea anemones, and we have one that's all about sea scallops. So we will look it up, and if the magazines don't tell us, then we can look it up	
16	24	From a different source	
16	24	You had maybe a ### in your hair still *laughing* Saving some for later? Would you like to go across the hall to let them know that we have finished the second puzzle?	
16	24		Yeah
16	24		Yes
16	24	They're straight across in the room that you were in just a  couple minutes ago before we came in here	
16	24	Room 202. It says 202 next to the door, on a dark brown placard	
16	24		
16	24		###
16	24	Okay good	
16	24	Oh you needed t-

19	48	Wanna start with the ants?	
19	48		No
19	48	'Kay

19	48		The spotted cheetah?
19	48	Mmhmm. 'Kay let's put it on here, put it down

2	48	*laughing* Not at all?	
2	48		Well we did two puzzles. Guess what

2	48		She had to do one of the puzzles
2	48	Uh-huh	
2	48		And so, do you know what?
2	48	What?	
2	48		She put the pieces in the wrong places. And sometimes she put them like sideways or something
2	48	So, how did you- Did you have to help her get it right?	
2	48		Yes
2	48	Did you have to put it all together or just tell her what to do?	
2	48		Just tell her what to do
2	48	Eventually	
2	48		But for one I had to put together
2	48	Okay	
2	48	So when she did it wrong was it hard to tell her how to do it right?	
2	48		Mm-mm
2	48	No? *laughing*	
2	48		Because I know, You know I am very good at those board puzzles
2	48	Mm-hmm

2	48	Mm-hmm. Do you wanna know the name of that kind of frog?	
2	48		Red-eyed tree frog
2	48	Yeah	
2	48		Because, those frogs live in the tree so it's called a red-eyed tree frog
2	48	That's right	
2	48		Not a red-eyed frog
2	48	That's right	
2	48		A tree frog
2	48	Some of 'em are poison dart frogs, too. But I guess not that one, huh?	
2	48		Mm-mm because that one has red-eyed

2	48	*noises*	
2	48	Might wanna check this one again

2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48	Here's the sloth	
2	48		
2	48		A cute little sloth
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48	Have we read that book in a while, at home?	
2	48	The sloth book, Slowly slowly slowly s-	
2	48		Not very much
2	48	You wanna read that tonight?	
2	48		Sure
2	48	*Name* used to love that book	
2	48	Do you know all the animals in the back?	
2	48		
2	48		That the sloth had to go by
2	48	Uh-huh. *Name* used to make us read 'em to him over and over and over	
2	48	It would take forever to get through that book	
2	48		
2	48		Does he like it as much now?
2	48	Well, he's a lot older, so I don't know. Probably hasn't looked at it in a long time	
2	48		You're right, he hasn't
2	48	Those are all in your room, now	
2	48		Mm-hmm
2	48		It's all in my room because I think then when he stopped and did not liking it too much anymore then he gave it to me, right?
2	48	Yep	
2	48		And so it could be a present for me
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48		And then when I didn't like it as much we could just save it in case if we just want to read it once in a while
2	48	Mm-hmm. You could read it to your babies	
2	48		
2	48		Yeah
2	48	And when *Name* ever comes to visit	
2	48		Mm-hmm
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48		###
2	48	Top part, huh?	
2	48		I don't know
2	48	Is there a parrot? Or a toucan or something?	
2	48		I think, there might be
2	48	Uh-oh	
2	48		Hey, where's sloth
2	48		Here's sloth
2	48		*singing*
2	48		
2	48		You're right there might be a toucan or something like that
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48	This looks like part of them. Don't know where else that one goes	
2	48		We need it though
2	48		
2	48	Look at that ant	
2	48	Would you like to meet that ant in the woods?	
2	48		I don't think so
2	48	*laughing* I don't think so	
2	48	Looks like there's a couple of 'em on this puzzle	
2	48		I think there is a couple
2	48		It does look like there might be a toucan
2	48		There might be a toucan
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48		I don't know
2	48		We'll have to find out when we're finished
2	48	Oops	
2	48	Do you wanna try doing some edge pieces? See if that helps?	
2	48	Figure out where the toucan is?	
2	48		Sure
2	48		It
2	48	Aah, There you go	
2	48		
2	48	That's where that one goes	
2	48		*humming*
2	48		
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48		Because I was doing that so that might something might go there
2	48	This might not go right here. This might be a different corner	
2	48		Oh, it might
2	48		Different corners
2	48		I'll just leave it there because it could be a different, could be that
2	48	Yeah 'cause this all definitely goes at the bottom. And then this one doesn't- probably won't quite fit in there	
2	48		No 'cause look how it is
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48	See how those don't ###	
2	48		Mmm, yeah
2	48		So I guess it might go there
2	48		
2	48	Yep	
2	48	Might go there	
2	48	Do you wanna find the other corner piece?	
2	48		No
2	48	Yeah	
2	48		No, don't want to
2	48	Okay	
2	48		
2	48	There ya go	
2	48	That's probably right	
2	48		Well

2	48		
2	48		Yep, it probably was
2	48	Yep	
2	48	Oh there's part of him	
2	48		
2	48		Oh it might actually just be a regular bird
2	48	We'll have to see what his beak looks like when you're done	
2	48		Hmmm
2	48	You wanna try this piece?	
2	48		
2	48		
2	48		
2	48		There's a couple ants
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48	Do you remember that box of Christmas puzzles we have in the basement?	
2	48		
2	48		Yeah
2	48	Should we do some of those this year?	
2	48		Sure, maybe, when it's Christmas
2	48	Well yeah	
2	48		
2	48	Some of those are tricky	
2	48		Mm-hmm some of 'em are tr- very tricky actually
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48		*singing*
2	48		
2	48	Now, Oh yeah, that looks right	
2	48	You're almost done! Just a few more pieces	
2	48		
2	48		
2	48		
2	48	This a cute puzzle	
2	48		
2	48	There's your froggy	
2	48		Where's does this piece go?
2	48	I don't know	
2	48	What is it part of?	
2	48		Sloth
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48		I think it might actually go there
2	48		
2	48	Mm-hmm	
2	48		Let me see where this piece goes
2	48		
2	48	Does that look right?	
2	48		Maybe It connects to here
2	48	Yep	
2	48	That's it	
2	48		
2	48		Oh!
2	48		###
2	48	Is that his beak?	
2	48		Uh-huh
2	48	Yeah	
2	48	So is that a parrot or a toucan?	
2	48		What is that?
2	48		
2	48	One of them has a colorful beak and one doesn't	
2	48		Umm
2	48	I think this is a toucan	
2	48	I think the parrots have the smaller, kind of black beaks	
2	48	And then the colored feathers	
2	48		Yeah, It's a toucan
2	48		That's what it is
2	48		It's a toucan
2	48		
2	48		I only have, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 more pieces
2	48	Or it could be a macaw, too	
2	48	Yep	
2	48		
2	48	There's your sloth	
2	48		
2	48		Now only two more
2	48	Yep	
2	48		I know this
2	48		
2	48		This is e-, This, That
2	48		Was
2	48		Easy
2	48		
2	48		
2	48	But it was fun to do, wasn't it?	
2	48		Mm-hmm
2	48	How colorful it is	
2	48	Cool	
2	48		I love that butterfly
2	48	Oh, yeah	
2	48	Alright, should we go tell her you're done?	
2	48	Alright	
2	48	Remember where she was sitting over there?	
2	48		
2	48	Did you like it?	
2	48	Yeah, Nice and colorful	
2	24		
2	24	Oh, What's on this one?	
2	24		What's that?
2	24	That looks like	
2	24		An upside-down octopus?
2	24		
2	24	Or an upside-down jellyfish	
2	24	Right?	
2	24		Yeah, jellyfish
2	24	I think it has	
2	24		mmm
2	24	More than 8 legs	
2	24		This is a jellyfish
2	24	That's a jellyfish	
2	24	I don't know what that is	
2	24		1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
2	24	So can it be a octopus?	
2	24		Actually it's 13
2	24	So is that an octopus?	
2	24	Nope	
2	24	*laughing*	
2	24		'Cause it's 13, not 8
2	24	That's right	
2	24		And this is an octopus
2	24	Yep, that's an octopus	
2	24		That's a crab
2	24	Uh-huh	
2	24		What's this?
2	24		Oh that's seaweed
2	24	Uh-huh	
2	24		Whale
2	24	Uh-huh	
2	24		Shark
2	24	Uh-huh	
2	24		And what's this?
2	24		Swordfish
2	24	Yeah	
2	24		Seahorse, Jellyfish
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		So what can that be?
2	24		Starfish
2	24	This could just be	
2	24	Oh I don't know	
2	24		
2	24		Well
2	24		Maybe when we're finished we can ask her
2	24	Yeah, that's a good idea	
2	24	And what's this one there?	
2	24		Shell
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		Seashell
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		There!
2	24	Do you want help taking it apart?	
2	24		Yeah
2	24	Can we mix up the pieces?	
2	24	We can make it a little trickier	
2	24		No, usually when I mix up pieces it isn't trickier at all
2	24	*laughing*	
2	24	Okay	
2	24		But we're just mixing 'em up just in case if this one is a little tricky ###
2	24	It might be	
2	24		It might, but I don't think so
2	24		Plus, board puzzles are easy
2	24	What's your hard puzzle?	
2	24	What's the hardest one you tried to do?	
2	24		mmm
2	24	How about the Charlie Brown pumpkin one that we could never finish? *laughing*	
2	24		*laughing* yes
2	24		Yes, that is definitely that one
2	24	I couldn't even do that one	
2	24	We had to give up	
2	24	*laughing*	
2	24		And we had to give it back to grandma before we were even finished
2	24	I know, maybe next year	
2	24		Because we would never be finished with it
2	24	Next year you'll be five	
2	24	And then maybe	
2	24	You can help me more with it	
2	24		I'll be better
2	24	Yeah *laughing*	
2	24		Every year I just keep getting better and better at puzzles
2	24		
2	24	That's right	
2	24		*singing* *humming*
2	24		What's this?
2	24	This looks like, do you remember what that's part of?	
2	24		Swordfish
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		
2	24	Yep	
2	24		
2	24		What's this?
2	24		
2	24		Yeah
2	24	What is that	
2	24		It's the jellyfish
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		Ya'know, mom
2	24		
2	24	*laughing* what	
2	24		Puzzles are easy
2	24	Well, not all of 'em	
2	24	Even if they're easy they're fun to do, especially when you get a new one, right?	
2	24		Well
2	24		Mm-hmm
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		Good c- because when we went in that room
2	24	Uh-huh	
2	24		That puzzle was fun to do, and it was new
2	24	Yeah	
2	24		She said it was new
2	24	Yeah	
2	24	And was it, so, she did the farm one, and what one did you do by yourself?	
2	24		mmm
2	24		Let me think
2	24		Umm
2	24		Let me think
2	24		
2	24	Do you know who that guy is?	
2	24	Think of your vitamins	
2	24		
2	24		Seahorse
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		And a starfish is my vitamin
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		Wait, am I putting my vitamins in this puzzle?
2	24	*laughs* I think a few of 'em	
2	24		Yeah
2	24		Because my vitamin is not a jellyfish
2	24		
2	24		And I do not have a octopus vitamin
2	24	That's true	
2	24		
2	24		
2	24		No no, I do not
2	24	So what's that guy? That's the shark?	
2	24		
2	24		Shark
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		And my vitamin
2	24		
2	24		*laughing*
2	24	*laughing*	
2	24		*laughing*
2	24		Does this have a regular fish?
2	24	It has a whole bunch. Do you see the shadows of them all?	
2	24	Kinda like on our shower curtain, there's all those	
2	24	Fish on it	
2	24		Yeah
2	24		
2	24		
2	24	Is that guy a lobster or a crab?	
2	24		Crab
2	24	What's, do you know the difference?	
2	24		Because lobsters sometimes go on land, I think
2	24		Do they stay in the water
2	24	I think they stay in the water, unless people catch them to eat them	
2	24	What's that part of?	
2	24		Jellyfish
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		
2	24		That's not my vitamin, That's my vitamin
2	24	Mm-hmm	
2	24		And that's also my puzzle
2	24	Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, you have a starfish puzzle	
2	24	Or a, seahorse puzzle, right?	
2	24		mmm
2	24	One of those little ones	
2	24		
2	24		Where does this go?
2	24	I don't know	
2	24		There?
2	24	Does that look right?	
2	24		No
2	24		That doesn't go there
2	24		It goes, umm
2	24	Maybe you have to wait	
2	24		Yeah, maybe I have to wait
2	24		I'll wait
2	24		
2	24		*singing*
2	24	Do you know what these little things are called?	
2	24		What
2	24	That, that stick to, um	
2	24	Other fish?	
2	24		No
2	24	Those are barnacles	
2	24		Barnacles?
2	24	Uh-huh	
2	24	In one of our books we- It talks about Barnacles	
2	24	They kind of live. They're living things and they live, in the skin, I guess	
2	24		Is this swordfish killing the shark?
2	24	Mmm, Does it look like it, or does it look like he's jumping up?	
2	24		
2	24		It looks like he might be jumping up so that he can try to catch the shark's fin
2	24	Maybe	
2	24	The shark looks like he might be pretty fast	
2	24		
2	24	Swimming away	
2	24		Mm-hmm
2	24	You think?	
2	24		Maybe
2	24		
2	24		Yes, maybe I had to wait on this one
2	24	Now do you know where it is?	
2	24		Maybe it goes there
2	24		
2	24	Yep	
2	24		Now I know where the rest of the piece goes
2	24		Oh
2	24		I know where the rest of the pieces go
2	24		
2	24	Can you see the barnacles there? Underneath the	
2	24	What is that guy?	
2	24		
2	24		The whale
2	24	Uh-huh, under him	
2	24		I'm gonna be so fast at this one
2	24		
2	24	*laughs*	
2	24		
2	24		
2	24	Alright	
2	24		Done!
2	24		Now should we go and ask what that purple thing is?
2	24	Very good!	
2	24	Yeah! Let's go ask her	
2	24	Can you get out?	
2	24	Okay	
2	24		
2	24	You can show her, 'Cause I don't know the answer	
2	24	Do you remember that? Have you seen that movie?	
2	24	The anemone, where he kinda lives	
2	24	So fish can kinda swim inside there with those, and they hide from the sharks	
2	24		Oh
2	24	*laughs*	
2	24	So you're going to go with her and do one other game, and I have to take another test	
2	24	You like that	
2	24	You need help with that?	
2	24	Did you like that puzzle?	
2	24	There ya go	
			
	24 piece time		
	24 Parent Utt		
	24 Child Utterance		
	48 piece time		
	48 parent utt		
	48 Child utterance		
20	48		
20	48	Let's look at the picture first and remember what it's supposed to look like, okay	
20	48	'Cause we don't have a box this time. Let's look at the back, oh-	
20	48	Here's a picture of what it'll look like when it's done. Ready?	
20	48		
20	48		Mm-hmm
20	48	*noises*	
20	48	Okay	
20	48	Let's flip 'em all over	
20	48	Oh they're still stuck together	
20	48	Let's break 'em apart, break 'em apart, break 'em apart	
20	48		
20	48	Oh they're really sticky	
20	48		
20	48	I wonder what ## up to	
20	48	Okay now once we get 'em apart let's- we have to flip 'em all over	
20	48	So we can see the pictures, let's mix 'em up	
20	48	Sure to mix 'em up, 'cause it was all put together for us	
20	48	Okay let's flip 'em all over so we can see	
20	48	Flip	
20	48	Can you help?	
20	48	Yeah, let's flip the pieces over	
20	48	Did you have fun doing those other puzzles?	
20	48		Mm-hmm
20	48	Yeah?	
20	48	Come on, let's flip 'em over	
20	48		
20	48	Got a bunch on your side	
20	48	## gotta flip 'em over so we can see	
20	48	The pictures, right?	
20	48		Think I want to put it right here
20	48	Wait, let's- Remember we have to do it like we do at home?	
20	48	So, first we have to find all the edge pieces, right?	
20	48		Mmm
20	48	Like, the pieces with a straight side?	
20	48	Yeah, there's one	
20	48	Okay, let's put those on the board first, and we'll just sort of	
20	48	We'll move the other ones out of our way for now, so we can get the frame-	
20	48		There
20	48	Ooh yeah	
20	48	Okay, I see one corner	
20	48	Another corner, let's look underneath and see which corner the butterfly is supposed to be in	
20	48	This corner, right?	
20	48		Uh-huh
20	48	So	
20	48		###
20	48	This goes over here then, right?	
20	48		Mm-hmm, and this goes over...
20	48	And I'll keep looking for edge pieces. You can start putting them together if you see some that-	
20	48		Here
20	48		Here
20	48	Yeah, NAME	
20	48	If you see some that go together	
20	48	Go ahead and-	
20	48	Fit 'em together. Any more edges? Sorry	
20	48		Is that where it goes?
20	48	Mmm, does that really fit? Does that- Not quite	
20	48		No
20	48	Any more edge pieces?	
20	48	*gasp* This- Where do you think- Which corner do you think this belongs in?	
20	48		Let's check on the board
20	48	Mmm, well let's take a guess. If the frog is sitting up, would it fit down here? Like this?	
20	48		It's sitting on the rose!
20	48		###
20	48	Well, if it's sitting it should be this way, right?	
20	48		Right
20	48	Which corner?	
20	48	That one? But, look, I'm covering it up but	
20	48	This has two straight sides	
20	48	So it has to fit into one of these corners, this corner's full	
20	48	Does that look right?	
20	48		No
20	48	What about over here?	
20	48		
20	48		Yes
20	48		
20	48	Yeah, okay	
20	48	Any more edges?	
20	48	Here's one	
20	48		Mmm
20	48	See any more?	
20	48		Here's one
20	48	Here's one, with a little piece of butterfly on it, and some mushrooms, is that a hint?	
20	48		Here
20	48	Mushrooms	
20	48	Grow up from the ground #	
20	48		Where's the mushroom, the other mushroom piece?
20	48	There's one	
20	48	Found another corner	
20	48	It could go up here	
20	48		###
20	48	Or it could go down here	
20	48		I haved fun having puzzles
20	48	Which-	
20	48	What kinds of puzzles did you do? Here, let's put these together	
20	48		I did the dinosaur, I did farm, and I did animals
20	48	Wanna help?	
20	48	I don't think that goes there, but-	
20	48		Um
20	48		What does ###-
20	48	Does that go together?	
20	48		Yes!
20	48		
20	48	Great. Hey you can- you can get started on the butterfly pieces if you want	
20	48		What does- Where does this go?
20	48	Hmm, I don't know	
20	48		Maybe it goes here
20	48	Maybe	
20	48		You think that looks right?
20	48	I can't see, Does that look right? Hmm Oops, we lost a piece	
20	48		No
20	48	Not quite	
20	48	What about if we do, It's gotta go on-	
20	48		###
20	48	This straight edge has to go on one of these straight sides, right?	
20	48	Does that look quite right? No	
20	48		No
20	48	Not quite, what about down here?	
20	48		No
20	48		No
20	48	No?	
20	48		Y- Yes!
20	48	That little piece is broken	
20	48		It looks- It look- Yeah
20	48	Yeah, so why don't you finish up on the butterfly	
20	48	And I'll keep	
20	48	Working over here	
20	48		Do you think that looks right?
20	48		
20	48	I think that looks just right	
20	48	You got some more um-	
20	48	Where does this go?	
20	48		Butterfly pieces
20	48	Does that-	
20	48		Yes! It looks right
20	48	Does it? It does look right, but, the mushrooms- Let's take a look at our- at our picture	
20	48		No
20	48	The mushrooms have to be on the bottom	
20	48		Probably yeah
20	48	So	
20	48	Maybe	
20	48	Unless we're looking at that picture sideways	
20	48	Butterfly	
20	48	Oh boy, NAME. Silly Mom	
20	48		###
20	48		What?
20	48	This actually goes over here	
20	48		What silly mom
20	48		
20	48	I was looking at it sideways and my brain didn't flip it over	
20	48		What brain?
20	48		
20	48	My brain inside my head	
20	48		
20	48	That looks better	
20	48		Yeah
20	48	That makes more sense	
20	48		I think this one goes right... here
20	48		
20	48	I think I see some butterfly in that- on that kitty's nose	
20	48	So maybe	
20	48		
20	48	Maybe that goes, you know, closer to the butterfly	
20	48		
20	48		Do you think that looks right?
20	48		
20	48	What?	
20	48	Show me	
20	48		Do you think this... looks right?
20	48	No, not quite, maybe this- Does that look like a butterfly's body?	
20	48		Yes
20	48	Okay try to fit it in where you think it should go	
20	48		
20	48		
20	48		
20	48		
20	48		Hey! It fit
20	48	Hey, nice. And I can see some of the spots on that-	
20	48	Is this a leopard or a jaguar?	
20	48		Jaguar. Because it has spots
20	48	Cool. So...	
20	48		
20	48	What about, um	
20	48		
20	48	What about the, any m- Are there any other c-	
20	48		Hey, we're doing great!
20	48	We're doing great, yeah. Are there any more butterfly pieces that you can find?	
20	48		
20	48		Um
20	48		
20	48	Look for that bright blue. I think it's the only thing with that nice	
20	48		This
20	48	And here's an extra piece that was flipped over on it's face	
20	48	That looks like it might have part of the kitty nose on it	
20	48		
20	48		It works!
20	48	Nice, NAME	
20	48	And here's a piece that I think goes right here	
20	48		
20	48		Here's a piece that I think it fits right... here
20	48		
20	48		
20	48		Hey!
20	48	Yeah	
20	48		Yeah!
20	48	Nice, NAME	
20	48	Let's see, any- Do you see any more pieces of that big kitty?	
20	48	Any spotted parts?	
20	48	Yeah, that i- that looks like a piece. Any others?	
20	48	Where are the cat's eyes?	
20	48		Here
20	48		Here's the cat's eyes
20	48	Oh, where do those go?	
20	48		Right
20	48		Here
20	48	Yeah, it looks right. Does it fit?	
20	48		
20	48		No
20	48	Well you've gotta... drop it from the top	
20	48	Is, Oh. Maybe if we flip it? *noises*	
20	48	What do you think?	
20	48		Yes! Yes!
20	48		
20	48	Yeah	
20	48	We'll rotate it	
20	48		I found one!
20	48		
20	48	Try it	
20	48		
20	48	What is this?	
20	48		
20	48		It's ant
20	48		
20	48		It's a ant
20	48	Yeah, hey we're missing a corner piece. Oh-	
20	48	Do you want to fit it in?	
20	48		Yeah
20	48		
20	48	How 'bout another spot?	
20	48	And	
20	48	Just one little spot, where did that little piece c- belong	
20	48	Well there's where an ear maybe, maybe a ear belongs there?	
20	48	Maybe this ear goes over here	
20	48		
20	48	Maybe this little cheek is missing a spot	
20	48	What do you think?	
20	48		
20	48	Yeah	
20	48	Here's another piece of the kitty	
20	48		
20	48	So now we have all of the frame done	
20	48	We just need to fit in...	
20	48		
20	48		Aah, there we go
20	48	Nice work NAME	
20	48	Okay, what's next, how 'bout the ants?	
20	48		Yeah

20	48		
20	48	Good job	
20	48		*gasp* ###
20	48	We've only got five pieces left, where does this-	
20	48		One, we only got one, two, three, four, five pieces left
20	48	So let's see if you can finish the puzzle	
20	48		Mom, mom the girl said "It's not your kid"
20	48	Hmm?	
20	48		I- The girl said "It's not your kid"
20	48	What's not your kid?	
20	48	*laughing*	
20	48		You know, kid double, double
20	48		kid ###
20	48	Oh, she said, Oh, in the, in the, in Tiny Titans you mean? Hey, can you fit these last five pieces in?	
20	48		Sure
20	48	Give it a shot	
20	48		Well I think it-
20	48		
20	48	Yeah	
20	48		And then, I think it goes
20	48	So the ah	
20	48		Right here
20	48	Does it? Do those leaves match up?	
20	48		No
20	48		
20	48		I think it #
20	48	Yes, there we go	
20	48		I found-
20	48	Is that a python?	
20	48	Or some kind of snake	
20	48	Maybe if you rotate it	
20	48		Mmm this one
20	48	Mmm	
20	48		No
20	48	You might have to rotate it	
20	48	Yeah	
20	48	So the- So the notches all match up	
20	48		
20	48	Yeah	
20	48	Looks like a friendly snake	
20	48	Close	
20	48	Do those colors line up?	
20	48		Yeah
20	48	Maybe you'll have to rotate that one too	
20	48		
20	48	Yeah	
20	48	One piece left	
20	48		Uh, you put it in
20	48		
20	48	Mmm, I think that might have to be rotated too	
20	48		
20	48		
20	48		*gasp*
20	48	Nice	
20	48	Good job, NAME	
20	48		Let's see- see it
20	48	Should I go get the girl?	
20	48	Ooh! *laughing* It started to pop out	
20	48		Mommy let's-
20	48		Mommy let's do another puzzle
20	48	Yeah there's one left	
20	48	Should I go get her so we can do the puzzle?	
20	48		Yeah
20	48	Okay	
20	48		I wanna go get her too
20	48	Okay, she's right in the next room	
20	48		
20	48		What next room?
20	48	Next room, right here	
20	48	###	
20	48	Ready for another?	
20	48	Ooh. Take a good look	
20	24		
20	24	Ooh, look at this, this whale has barnacles on it's chin	
20	24		
20	24		Where's the whale?
20	24	Do you remember- This is a whale	
20	24	See it's big, ah, big oval eye?	
20	24	###	
20	24	A swordfish	
20	24		Let's start
20	24	Okay	
20	24	Let's mix 'em up a little bit	
20	24	Okay, and then let's flip-	
20	24		We have one, two-
20	24	NAME, this time I want you to find the corners	
20	24		Okay
20	24	Remember, a corner has two straight sides- Ah! Careful	
20	24	Uh	
20	24		Where is *name*?
20	24	She's doing some games	
20	24		Where's the games at? Where's the games?
20	24	I don't know. In one of these rooms nearby. Okay, now you find the corners this time	
20	24		
20	24	One	
20	24		Does that look right?
20	24	Mmm, Maybe but, you did find a corner that's all I asked	
20	24	Three corners left	
20	24	A corner has two straight sides	
20	24	Does that have two straight sides?	
20	24		No
20	24	That's only got one	
20	24	But that is an edge piece	
20	24	I think I remember this big eye	
20	24		###
20	24	Is that the whale's eye?	
20	24		Yeah
20	24	So that goes over here, right?	
20	24	Like that?	
20	24		
20	24	But we still need three corners, do you see any?	
20	24	I think I found one	
20	24	You wanna just do the edges first?	
20	24		
20	24		No, look
20	24	You're doing it	
20	24		I did it
20	24	Okay, we'll do- We'll just do the edges and the corners. You find 'em	
20	24	Any pieces with straight side- Mmhmm	
20	24	Any others?	
20	24	Should be some more, right?	
20	24	There's one. Hey, that looks a little bit like this piece	
20	24	Oh yeah, Does that look like-	
20	24		Yeah!
20	24	Does that look like the top of the water? Like the-	
20	24		Yeah!
20	24	And the sky above? So this must go somewhere towards the top, right?	
20	24		Yeah, there!
20	24	But, it's a corner so... slide it over	
20	24		
20	24	Okay	
20	24	Now what?	
20	24		Hey that's a jellyfish
20	24	###	
20	24	It is a jellyfish	
20	24	Do you see any more... edge pieces or corners?	
20	24	Yes	
20	24	Hmm, that looks like a big smiling mouth	
20	24		*noises*
20	24		
20	24	Yeah	
20	24	Good	
20	24	What else?	
20	24		Nah- *gasp* Ooh
20	24	Yeah, you got another corner	
20	24		
20	24		It's part of the shark
20	24	Where does it go? I think I see that line again, the- the line where the water and the sky meet, but, it's a corner piece, right? So it goes in the-	
20	24		Uh
20	24	Corner pieces # go in the... corners, right?	
20	24		Mm-hmm
20	24	Yeah	
20	24	Okay	
20	24	See any more edge pieces?	
20	24	I see some	
20	24		I see one
20	24	Yeah, that's a corner too	
20	24	Nice, so you have all four corners. Now we need some more edges	
20	24		
20	24	What's up here? That light blue sky, right?	
20	24		Mom mom mom!
20	24	You found one!	
20	24	Yeah, that goes somewhere at the top	
20	24	Now it looks like you have one, two more top edge pieces	
20	24	They probably also have that like, light blue sky on them	
20	24		Mom!
20	24		I think it goes right here
20	24	mmm	
20	24		Nah
20	24	Nah, doesn't quite fit in	
20	24	Let's keep looking for those edge pieces, then we can put 'em together	
20	24	Do I hear *name*?	
20	24		Let me go check
20	24	if she's all done- Let's not check, let's finish ours and then we can go check	
20	24	Here, can I scoot you in? Oops, sorry	
20	24		###
20	24		Hey
20	24		Hey
20	24	Yeah	
20	24		
20	24	Any more edge pieces?	
20	24		
20	24	I think I found one, Oops	
20	24		I found one
20	24	Good!	
20	24	See any of that orange anywhere?	
20	24	On any of the other edges?	
20	24		No
20	24	What about any of the corners?	
20	24		Yeah
20	24		
20	24	Good!	
20	24		
20	24		Does that look right?
20	24	Yeah it does	
20	24	Okay we need a few more edges	
20	24	Yeah	
20	24	It looks like we need one-	
20	24	two, three, four, five more edge pieces	
20	24	So let's look for some clues	
20	24	We got this red crab	
20	24	We got the orange octopus	
20	24	But that's not an edge piece, right?	
20	24	Looks like it goes somewhere nearby, though	
20	24	Doesn't have a straight edge on it	
20	24	Right?	
20	24		It doesn't go there
20	24	We need some straight edged pieces	
20	24	mmm	
20	24	Maybe this slides over here	
20	24		
20	24	Yeah	
20	24		
20	24	And then you've got purple next	
20	24	See any- Yeah	
20	24		That's purple octopus
20	24	Where's that straight edge?	
20	24	NAME look at your piece	
20	24	Look at your puzzle piece	
20	24	Where's the straight edge go?	
20	24	Mm-hmm	
20	24		
20	24	Good! Okay, now we've got the orange octopus and the gray shark	
20	24		
20	24	Yeah	
20	24		
20	24	And some more gray shark	
20	24		
20	24	Yeah	
20	24		Does it go right here?
20	24		
20	24	Yes	
20	24	Any more edges?	
20	24	I think we're missing two edge pieces	
20	24	You wanna do that c- crab?	
20	24		Mm-hmm
20	24	Rotate	
20	24		
20	24	mm-hmm	
20	24	Now what?	
20	24		I think we should rotate it
20	24		Nah
20	24	Hmm	
20	24	I see this blue color	
20	24	Where does that piece belong? And I also see a little bit of pink. Yeah	
20	24		
20	24	Good	
20	24		It's-
20	24	Now what?	
20	24	Is that a baby or a toy?	
20	24	You can move ##	
20	24	Sometimes you gotta wiggle it into place	
20	24		
20	24	Good. Three, four more pieces	
20	24	You're almost done	
20	24	Barnacles, right?	
20	24		Mm-hmm
20	24		
20	24	And, can you find a-	
20	24	Who's fin is that? Is that the shark's fin or is that somebody else's fin?	
20	24		Somebody else's
20	24	Whose is it?	
20	24	You've got a good clue on here. It's a- it's got a straight edge on it	
20	24	Yeah	
20	24		
20	24	Only two pieces left	
20	24		
20	24		
20	24		
20	24	Yay! Nice work	
20	24		I wanna go see *name*
20	24	You wanna go see if *name* is here? Okay	
20	24		I go see *name*
20	24		
20	24	Okay NAME, well, er, I'll hold your ###	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
21	24		
21	24	Alright	
21	24	Should we take it out?	
21	24		Mm-hmm
21	24	Okay, should we dump it?	
21	24		Uh-huh
21	24	That's kinda the fun part of puzzles, huh?	
21	24		
21	24	Okay, one, two, three, dump!	
21	24		Uh-huh
21	24		*laughing*
21	24	Okay now we gotta mix up the pieces!	
21	24	Mix 'em up, mix 'em up, can you help me mix 'em?	
21	24		I'm a scientist!
21	24	You're a scientist? Okay	
21	24		## let's find out where the- where all the whales # Let's find out where the whales are scientist!
21	24	Okay	
21	24	Let's find out where the whales are, scientist. Let's put this puzzle together	
21	24	Okay, oy oy oy, I dropped some pieces, uh-oh. Uh-oh	
21	24		But but but!
21	24	but but!	
21	24		I have a special computer that shows the whales
21	24	Oh you do? Okay, well let's put together your computer screen so that we can find the whales	
21	24	So let's see. Oh boy this is kind of a tough puzzle	
21	24	so let's see, maybe we can find some edges first	
21	24	Can you find some straight edges? Straight parts?	
21	24		
21	24	Let's see, let's put together some pieces- Oh look! NAME, look. So, what does- Can you find the- the head of the seahorse? Yellow and spiky like that?	
21	24		Hey
21	24	I bet you can find it	
21	24		Could you move the chair over?
21	24	Over by me?	
21	24		No, no move the table over
21	24	Move the table over?	
21	24		Mm-hmm
21	24	Table over where?	
21	24		##
21	24	Well no we- we can just move our chairs we can't move the table	
21	24	No no no no please don't move the table You wanna push back?	
21	24		# Yeah
21	24	Why? Don't you wanna do the puzzle with me?	
21	24		#
21	24		See? How it's better to do this?
21	24	*laughing* Well I see but it's not better for doing a puzzle	
21	24		Oh!
21	24	Yeah, can you find the rest of the seahorse?	
21	24		Oh, yeah but I have to push, my scientist chair back in
21	24	Yeah, you better scoot your scientist chair back in. Okay	
21	24		*noises*
21	24		Put it- Scoo- scoot it back in
21	24	Okay, Oy	
21	24	Okay. Okay scientist. Are you a seahorse scientist?	
21	24		Mm-hmm
21	24	Okay can you find #-	
21	24		And whale scientist!
21	24	Okay, a whale scientist and a seahorse scientist. Okay so let's look for something that's yellow, and spiky, and a head of a seahorse *gasp*	
21	24	There you go! Alright. Now this, hmm, this kinda looks like a pink jellyfish. Can you find anything that looks like a pink jellyfish? Alright, that looks like part of it	
21	24	Hmm, Let's see, anything else? I think that's a good guess I think we should save that	
21	24	Here maybe is some more	
21	24	Let's find all the pink-	
21	24	Jellyfishy pieces	
21	24	Oh, hey great job!	
21	24	Very good! So now, this looks like it's a corner, here	
21	24	So, should we put it in the, in the tray?	
21	24		Mm-hmm
21	24	So, where do you think this corner is gonna go? I'll help you lift it	
21	24		
21	24	Okay	
21	24	Yeah, so we'll move it up here, oops, oh, oh boy! oh boy! We're losing our pieces!	
21	24		
21	24		
21	24	Okay, you-	
21	24		It's better if I do it like this, see?
21	24	Okay, I see. You're doing a great job! So let's see	
21	24		I was right!
21	24	*sigh*	
21	24		
21	24	You were right!	
21	24	Aah, ok-	
21	24		I wasn't wrong?
21	24	You were not wrong. So let's see, can you find any more jellyfishy pieces?	
21	24	Some pink jellyfishy pieces, like maybe this one?	
21	24		
21	24	Oh yeah, and the seahorse's nose. Good job. Okay, now, let's see what else there is, there's something blue here, with a blue fin	
21	24	Can you find something that's that color blue?	
21	24	Mmkay, hmm	
21	24	And maybe it's one- Oh oh! Maybe, here try turning that	
21	24	'Cause see here's some pink	
21	24		
21	24	Yeah! Great job	
21	24	Okay so then there's more blue	
21	24	So let's find pieces that have blue	
21	24	And a straight edge, 'cause there'll be a straight edge up here	
21	24	So let's see can you find anything that has blue?	
21	24	I think I see one. And it has blue, and some water drops coming off that look like this	
21	24	Look for some water drops like this	
21	24	Mmm, not quite. L- That's a good guess though, that has some water drops	
21	24	*gasp* try that, okay	
21	24		
21	24	Great! Alright!	
21	24		No, we need it's head
21	24	Yeah, now we need to find it's head. Maybe there's an eye on it or something	
21	24	Hmm	
21	24		
21	24	It's kind of a toughie	
21	24	mmm	
21	24		Blue!
21	24	Yeah, you're right that's blue, it's a little bit different color blue	
21	24	Oh, you know what I think it is? I think it's a little bit tricky	
21	24	Because I think this is a swordfish. And so it has a long beak kind of a thing. Can you find something with a long beak on the table?	
21	24		Hmm
21	24	Hmm	
21	24		This is a little bit tricky
21	24	It is a tricky puzzle, it is	
21	24		Uh-huh
21	24	Yeah	
21	24		Mm-hmm
21	24	So let's see, a long yellow beak	
21	24		A-ha!
21	24		I think I see one
21	24	Look, look over on this side	
21	24	Look over here	
21	24	Look over here. Long yellow beak	
21	24		*gasp*
21	24	Look for something long and yellow. Over here, Look over here	
21	24		Where?
21	24	Do you see something long and yellow?	
21	24	There you go *gasp* Great job!	
21	24		
21	24		What's the fish saying?
21	24	He says "Thanks for putting me together I need the very tippy end of my nose." Can you find the very tippy end of this yellow piece? Another yellow piece like that?	
21	24	*gasp* Wow great job	
21	24		
21	24		Hmm, seems like this black whale
21	24	Yeah	
21	24	There's some, yep. Let's see	
21	24	Hmm not quite	
21	24	Yeah maybe, yeah maybe. Try that	
21	24		
21	24	Oh hey! Good job!	
21	24		Now there's one more piece
21	24	Yeah, let's see, now okay, now that has a straight edge, so that's gonna go against, yeah yeah yeah! Great!	
21	24		
21	24	Alright	
21	24	So we need some more of this shark	
21	24	Alright	
21	24	Hmm	
21	24	I think, here well, if a piece goes there, it has to have some, here try that piece, where is another- where is another piece of the shark would- would need some, 'cause this- this looks like- Look, it looks like the shark's head with his teeth, so maybe put that towards the front of the shark	
21	24	Yeah yeah yeah, I think- ah no I think you were right	
21	24	Yeah yeah	
21	24		What's the shark say?
21	24	Oh, uh maybe, ah yeah no it seems like it should work. Oh there you go! Great job!	
21	24		
21	24		What's the shark say?
21	24	He says "Thanks for putting me together I guess I won't eat you up now"	
21	24	He does need a little bit of his tail, still. So there needs to be a piece with some gray on it. And some orange for the octopus. It'll have a gray nubby part.	
21	24		What's- What's he saying when he can't swim yet?
21	24	He says "I can't swim yet 'cause my tail isn't all together yet"	
21	24		Hmm
21	24	Hmm	
21	24		We say "Don't worry Mr. Whale, we'll fix you"
21	24	Yep we will. Let's find another eye for the octopus too	
21	24		Mommy
21	24	# Yes ##	
21	24		Mommy, uh, you say "Don't worry Mr... Octopus" Oh, say "don't worry Mr. Whale we'll fix you"
21	24	Don't worry Mr. Whale we'll fix you	
21	24		What's the whale saying?
21	24	He says "Oh I sure hope so"	
21	24	I think the rest of my tail is on a piece with an eye for an octopus	
21	24	*gasp* Mmm	
21	24		Hmm
21	24		
21	24	Great! Alright	
21	24		Mmm What's- What's he saying?
21	24	He says "Thanks for- Thanks for putting me together"	
21	24	Okay now we need the rest of the octopus	
21	24		What's the- octopus saying?
21	24	He says "Hey put me together. I need all my legs"	
21	24		Oh he's- he's supposed to say, "I need all my legs"
21	24	I need all my legs. All eight of them	
21	24		No! He's supposed to say "I need my legs"
21	24	I need my legs. Please put my legs on me	
21	24		
21	24		wait
21	24	*gasp*	
21	24		
21	24	Great	
21	24		What's he saying when he can't swim yet?
21	24	He says "I can't- I still can't swim yet! I need more legs!"	
21	24		
21	24		Now what's he saying?
21	24	Now he says "Oh! Almost all my legs!"	
21	24	I think there's a starfish with its legs	
21	24		*gasp*
21	24		What's the starfish saying?
21	24	Oh, try it in the corner. See how it's a corner?	
21	24		
21	24	Great job. Okay	
21	24		What's- What's he say?
21	24	The starfish is saying "Oh, thanks for putting me together!" Now it looks like there's going to be something with some sand and some purple stuff	
21	24	So look for some purple anemone things	
21	24	Oh yeah, there's a good one	
21	24		It's a purple, and a anemone thing?
21	24	Anemone	
21	24		Why?
21	24	Yep, make the straight edge match the straight edge of the-	
21	24		Of the amanemone?
21	24	No no no no. You're right, you're right. Here, leave these together. But see how there's a straight edge here? Where's the straight edge on this piece?	
21	24		*noises*
21	24	Yeah, so here, turn it so the straight edge matches	
21	24		
21	24	There! Good job!	
21	24		There
21	24	Now is there more purple somewhere? Can you see more purple, and sand somewhere?	
21	24	That has some purple but it doesn't have d- Oh, oh look at you! Yeah!	
21	24		
21	24		What's the octopus saying?
21	24	He says "Thank you so much" You put all the octopus together. Now we gotta finish up the anemone	
21	24		What's an, anemyenemy
21	24	*laughing* an anemone? It's like a weird under-sea thing that has lots of-	
21	24	Things like that	
21	24	*gasp* Yeah	
21	24		
21	24	Great! Oh, there's a crab	
21	24		# the anemone
21	24		Oh!
21	24	The anemone is saying "Thank you!"	
21	24		Ah-
21	24		Ah!
21	24		Here's- Here's the rest of the crab
21	24	Right! Wow, we are getting close! Oh good job	
21	24		
21	24		What's the crab saying?
21	24	Mmkay	
21	24	He says "Thanks for putting me together we only have a few more pieces"	
21	24		*noises*
21	24	Hmm, I don't think that's quite right	
21	24	Oh!	
21	24		
21	24		Hey! it match- Hey! It makes the rest of his tail!
21	24	It sure does, look at that!	
21	24		*laughing* Is that neat!
21	24	That is neat!	
21	24		##
21	24	Okay, now it looks like something with some gray and blue together	
21	24	Okay	
21	24		That is gray and blue!
21	24	You're right! And what about this, see how these are gray and this color blue?	
21	24	So we've got just a couple more pieces	
21	24		mmm mmm mmm mmm
21	24	Oh, yeah, ##	
21	24	Oh, hmm. Wow!	
21	24		
21	24		mmm
21	24		mmm
21	24	Alright!	
21	24		How 'bout the rest?
21	24	Well, let's give it a try! Oh, remember the straight edge?	
21	24	Here's straight, straight with no nubbins, straight, so put the straight edge- line it up	
21	24	There you go	
21	24		What is it?
21	24		
21	24	Let's see, I don't know what tha- Oh, That's the head of a whale! So let's put the last one in so you can finish the whale!	
21	24	Match up the corner	
21	24		
21	24		
21	24	Great job! There's the whale!	
21	24		#

21	48	Well, how 'bout, I think, um, it might be a little easier, if we put together the butterfly first, 'cause that's nice and blue, and those pieces will be easy to find 	
21	48	Do you think we could do that?	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Hey! You found some butterfly pieces! Great job! Okay	
21	48		What the butterfly saying?
21	48	The butterfly is saying "Oh please put me together so that I can fly away!"	
21	48	Okay	
21	48		No, what's he saying when he- in the butterfly soup
21	48	Oh, the butterfly is saying "Please don't eat me in butterfly soup!"	
21	48		What are you saying?
21	48	Okay, so	
21	48		What's- What are you saying?
21	48	I'm saying "We'll see, butterfly, I don't know, we might eat you up"	
21	48	So let's get-	
21	48		What's the butterfly saying?
21	48	He says "Please don't eat me!"	
21	48	So let's get all the pieces of the butterfly. Can you find more butterfly pieces?	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Great	
21	48	Okay, now, is that another piece? Okay	
21	48	Mmm, I don't know, I don't know, I don't think that's quite right	
21	48		Uh uh uh
21	48	It's a good guess though	
21	48		Uh
21	48	Here's a piece of butterfly	
21	48		*noises*
21	48		
21	48	Mmm this one is gonna be hard	
21	48	*gasp* There you go, great	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	So, let's see. Hmm, don't think so	
21	48	Hold on, hold on, Okay let's get it in the-	
21	48	It's okay, okay here we go	
21	48	Here we go, I'm gonna...	
21	48	Move this, let's see, I think it goes-	
21	48		*noises*
21	48		
21	48	Here	
21	48	Think the butterfly was down here. Okay. Was there more butterfly?	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Hmm	
21	48	And there are some more butterfly pieces out here that we can use	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Yeah ## get that	
21	48	Great	
21	48		
21	48	Yeah, yeah there we go	
21	48	########	
21	48		
21	48	Nice!	
21	48	And what about- Where does this piece go?	
21	48	Oh, match up the straight edge, remember?	
21	48	*laughing* No, here, try it like this	
21	48		
21	48	There you go	
21	48	Whoa. I think there's a jaguar trying to look at us	
21	48		Why?
21	48	'Cause I think that's his nose!	
21	48	Should we put the rest of him together?	
21	48		What's the jaguar saying?
21	48	He says "Don't eat me up in your soup!"	
21	48		What are you saying?
21	48	I'm saying "I don't know, Jaguar. I don't want you to eat us!"	
21	48	Can you find the rest of his nose?	
21	48	This is kind of a tough puzzle, huh?	
21	48		Hmm
21	48		Hmm
21	48	Let's see	
21	48		What's he saying when he- when he sees that he's in the soup?!
21	48		
21	48	He says "Uh-oh I'm in a soup! I'm in the soup!"	
21	48	Okay well let's- So what we can do, is we can collect all the jaguar pieces. So, can you find more jaguar pieces? I found one! Here's one, we'll make a- we'll make some jaguar pieces right here	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Let's see I don't- ## And it's got some of the butterfly on it too it looks like, huh?	
21	48	I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if we're ready for that piece yet	
21	48	Here let's try- What does this look like to you?	
21	48		
21	48	There ya go	
21	48	Mmm I don't think that goes there yet. We need to find the- Mmm no, that's his eye. Okay, so let's find- Okay let's look for more jaguar pieces. Can you find more spots?	
21	48	Find more spots	
21	48		Oh, looks like there's a baby frog trying to look at us
21	48	Oh, there sure is	
21	48	Are you looking at us?	
21	48		What's he saying?
21	48	Do you wanna put some ants together instead?	
21	48		Mm-hmm
21	48	Okay, let's collect 'em. So find some ant pieces. I found one-	
21	48		Mmm what's the- What's the big frog saying?
21	48	He says "Well hello, please don't put me in your soup!"	
21	48		What are you saying when he's part of the puzzle?
21	48	He- I say "We're just gonna put you together as part of the puzzle, little froggy"	
21	48		What are you saying? What's he saying?
21	48	*sigh* He says "Alright, as long as it's just for a puzzle and not for soup"	
21	48	Okay	
21	48	Here, I found some-	
21	48		No, this puzzle is the soup!
21	48	Oh, this puzzle is the soup! Oh, sorry froggy this puzzle is some soup!	
21	48		What's this- What's the- What's the froggy saying?
21	48	He says "Oh, no, I'm in soup?"	
21	48	Do you wanna put the- You wanna finish putting this together? Is this one too hard?	
21	48		Uh-huh
21	48		Uh-huh
21	48	Let's see	
21	48	Alright	
21	48		Hmm
21	48	Should we finish- What sh- What would you like to do, would you like to do more of the jaguar or more ants? Or what?	
21	48		I- I'm gonna do more of the ##
21	48	Okay, that's a good idea	
21	48	Yeah, so yeah this is a piece of the jaguar. You found one. Can you find more pieces with spots?	
21	48		Mm
21	48	For the jaguar?	
21	48	Should we see- Oh I think, I think I see where this piece goes	
21	48		
21	48	How 'bout that?	
21	48		###
21	48	Now, can you find more of his eye?	
21	48	Well hon you- you gotta match his eye up	
21	48	Hmm, I don't think that's quite right, but I f- I see more jaguar eyes over here	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Yeah, ##	
21	48		It's- What's the jaguar saying?
21	48	He says "Roar! Please put me together!" Good job	
21	48	Okay, now, yeah, now try that one. Now I think we're ready for that one	
21	48		
21	48	Great job, Ta-da! Great job	
21	48		Ta-da!
21	48		What's the jaguar saying?
21	48	He says "There are still a few more pieces of me! They've got some spots on them!"	
21	48		What are the eyes saying?
21	48	The eyes are saying "Thanks for putting us together so that the jaguar can see!"	
21	48	Ooh I'm hot	
21	48	Alright, aah	
21	48		There!
21	48	Okay no no don't take apart the pieces that we've already put together!	
21	48		*laughing*
21	48	Please don't. Please don't. We worked long and hard- Honey, please don't take it apart	
21	48	Okay	
21	48		#####
21	48	You don't?	
21	48	Why not?	
21	48		#######
21	48	Okay, well can I- Can I do some of it then?	
21	48		Yeah, you can do all of it
21	48		
21	48	Okay well can you help me find the jaguar pieces? Can you help me find more pieces with spots?	
21	48	I don't see any	
21	48	*gasp* Oh there's one! Here, Okay	
21	48		*laughing* You didn't know it was there?
21	48	I didn't. Where does this- Where should this piece go	
21	48		
21	48		
21	48		Ta-da
21	48	Hey! You're pretty good at this!	
21	48	Alright. Hmm. Is there another piece with spots anywhere?	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Hmm, you're maybe- Try it over here on this side	
21	48		*noises*
21	48		*noises*
21	48		
21	48	Great	
21	48	Alright. Oh, and you know what? I see, the inside of the jaguar ear. It's kinda hard to see, on one of the pieces	
21	48	Lookit right there	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Oh maybe that's not right	
21	48	D'oh! I think it goes over here	
21	48		*laughing* *noises*
21	48	Oh, Mommy!	
21	48	Oh, Mommy!	
21	48		
21	48	Ah! There we go	
21	48	Mmkay	
21	48		What are the froggies saying?
21	48	The froggies are saying "When are you gonna put us together?"	
21	48		What are they saying when they're gonna be in the soup soon?
21	48	They say "Oh, we don't wanna be in the soup!"	
21	48	Okay, Look here's some mushrooms	
21	48		Where do-
21	48		What are the mushrooms saying?
21	48	Mushrooms are saying "Put us together, can you find any more mushrooms?"	
21	48		What are they saying when they want to be cooked up?!
21	48	They say "Oh, mushrooms are delicious in soup, can you cook us up please?"	
21	48	Can you find more mushrooms?	
21	48		So that animals can eat them?
21	48	Yeah?	
21	48	Mm-hmm	
21	48		I bet the animals would think they're re- they're very tasty!
21	48	I bet they will. Do you know where- Can you see more mushrooms on any of these pieces?	
21	48		I feel like those are marshmallows
21	48	Oh, those are marshmallows? Okay, well can you find more of them?	
21	48		So that the- So that the marshmallows will be yummy for the animals?
21	48	Uh-huh	
21	48		## But if they eat them when they're not cooked they'll say *noises*!
21	48	*laughing* Yeah	
21	48	So let's see, find some more of 'em	
21	48	I see some- There you go	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Match up the straight edge, remember?	
21	48		
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Great. Alright! Does it look like there are supposed to be- Oh I think there are supposed to be more mushrooms	
21	48		One more mushroom?
21	48	They're a little tricky. They're a little tricky. Okay	
21	48		Mushrooms?
21	48	Yeah, I am gonna, I'm gonna do a couple, just to get us going. So that we can get on to another animal, because there's an ant!	
21	48		##
21	48		
21	48		
21	48	Let's put the ant together #	
21	48		What's he saying when he wants to eat those mushr-
21	48	He says "I wanna eat those mushrooms, please put me together!"	
21	48		What's he saying when he wants to eat those marshmallows?
21	48	Can you-	
21	48	He says "I wanna eat 'em up, can you put me together so that I can eat 'em up?"	
21	48	Can you find more pieces of the ant?	
21	48	Oh, yeah, that's hard because that's a l- See how that's a little bit different color red?	
21	48	A little bit different	
21	48	Umm, but I see maybe over here there are some pieces of ant	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Mmm, try it a different way	
21	48		Oh! I remember that one
21	48		
21	48	Well there!	
21	48		What's the ant saying?
21	48	He says "Oh, thanks!" Now it looks like there's another ant back here, can you find another ant piece?	
21	48		Mm!
21	48	Oh you wanna do the rest of him?	
21	48		Mm-hmm
21	48	Okay. I think that's gonna be a little tricky. So I think there's a piece that has part of an ant and part of this tree trunk, on it. Can you find this- I think the tree trunk will be the easiest to see. Can you find this tree trunk?	
21	48	On one of the pieces?	
21	48	It's kind- This is a tough puzzle, huh?	
21	48	You're doing a great job with it	
21	48		Hmm
21	48	Look for, Look for brown, with some green on it	
21	48		
21	48	*kiss*	
21	48	Look over here	
21	48		*noises*
21	48	Now line up the, flat parts	
21	48	Yeah ##	
21	48		
21	48	There	
21	48	Okay, He says "Oh, thank you! So I can eat these marshmallows" See, he's got one in his mouth	
21	48		What's the ant say?
21	48	Now find this ant	
21	48	'Cause Oh, maybe that's just his- his- *noises,* thingy, probos- I don't know what it is. Uh, okay, so find this ant	
21	48	So we can put him together	
21	48		Mmm
21	48		*noises*
21	48	*laughing* Right	
21	48		*noises*
21	48		
21	48	Perfect	
21	48	Alright, so, Let's-	
21	48		He has a marshmallow in his mouth?
21	48	Yeah, I'm not sure if that's a marshmallow or if that's just like they have a jaw that comes out and *noises* they maybe they're like leaf-cutter ants that have funny, things	
21	48	Okay	
21	48		Actually, I think they're eating their marshmallows now
21	48	Mmm	
21	48	Oh, maybe so, that- that's nice, I bet they're pretty happy we put them together	
21	48		*laughing* I bet they're pretty- What's the- What's he saying?
21	48	The jaguar is saying "Thank you for putting me together too!"	
21	48		What's he saying when he's eating all the yummy ones?
21	48	He says "Oh, this is so yummy!" Ooh, it looks like there's a snake up here. I didn't even see him	
21	48		What's the snake saying?
21	48	He says "Can you put me together too?"	
21	48		That, he can eat the marshmallows right here?
21	48	Mm-hmm Mm-hmm	
21	48		So that he can slide over to the marshmallows?
21	48	Mm-hmm. *noises* Yep	
21	48		And share the marshmallows?
21	48		
21	48	So let's see, Oh, The snake is gonna be tough, 'cause he's green, and everything is green in this puzzle!	
21	48	Oh boy	
21	48	Gonna be tough	
21	48	I thi- Okay, I'm gonna put one piece in that I think is right and we'll see if it is, okay?	
21	48	'Cause see, I think this is the rest of the snake's eye, see there's his eye right there?	
21	48		
21	48	Look at that, there we go!	
21	48	Now, can you find, it's like green and white, it looks like	
21	48	Green and white	
21	48		Here let me show you this time
21	48	Okay	
21	48		With the ant- Crawl very far, ant
21	48	Ant crawl very far!	
21	48		#
21	48	Here	
21	48	Nope, go back, ant, go back	
21	48	Green and white	
21	48	Green and white. Look look look ## green and white	
21	48		Hey good job, ant!
21	48	Good job, ant	
21	48	Oh, here try it- See how there's a flat piece?	
21	48	Here	
21	48	Here maybe	
21	48	Uh, well here, see, see how there's flat up here?	
21	48		
21	48	Great! Great	
21	48	Alright. We're getting there! Look at how much we've done!	
21	48	So let's see... No no, please don't dump it! Please don't dump it!	
21	48		*laughing*
21	48	Oh my goodness	
21	48	So let's see, okay, Here's some spots, here's more spots	
21	48	NAME, honey please don't take it apart. Okay.	
21	48		##
21	48		I don't feel like doing it
21	48	You don't? Why not?	
21	48		'Cause, it's too frustrating
21	48	It is kinda frustrating, huh?	
21	48		Too frustrat-
21	48	Yeah	
21	48		Frustrating, too frustrating
21	48	Well, just because things are frustrating doesn't mean you shouldn't do them. It just means you have to work harder	
21	48	'Cause, 'cause the more frustrating things are, the better you feel when you get 'em done	
21	48	I do lots of frustrating things	
21	48	And I don't give up. You just can't give up. You just gave up	
21	48	Oh, now we've gotta put this all together again	
21	48		No, no it's because I don't feel like doing it
21	48	You don't?	
21	48		No
21	48	Why?	
21	48	We were doing so well, I really liked working with you	
21	48		Not now I don't
21	48	Aww	
21	48	Well, then I'll just put it together by myself	
21	48		*whining*
21	48		
21	48	What?	
21	48	What?	
21	48		I ### do the puzzle

21	48		## They just opened the door a little bit
21	48	Oh, did somebody just open the door a little bit?	
21	48		See?
21	48	Oh, it's been open like that. Can you please go get the other pieces?	
21	48		Oh
21	48		I don't wanna do it
21	48	Okay, well, I'm gonna do some more of it

22	48	Alright, you ready buddy?	
22	48		Yeah
22	48	Should we dump it out?-	
22	48		
22	48		Maybe we should take it apart with our hands
22	48	Okay let's take it all out	
22	48		See?
22	48	Should we dump it all out at once?	
22	48		Maybe-
22	48	You wanna do it?	
22	48		Yeah
22	48	You do it	
22	48	You turn it over and dump it	
22	48		
22	48		I- But I think it will stay together when we dump it out
22	48	Yes, you're right it did stay together, so let's mess it up!	
22	48	*noises*	
22	48		*noises*
22	48		Hey mommy!
22	48	Hey what!	
22	48		I think that toucan's trying to eat a berry

22	48		Yeah because I think he likes berries so much!
22	48	*laughing* Yeah?	
22	48		*noises*
22	48	So, what's a good way to start the puzzle?	
22	48		Put the pieces where they go
22	48	*laughing* Well yeah, that would be good, but how do you know that- where they go?	
22	48	What does Mommy always say? We should try and find the...	
22	48		*noises* ###
22	48		Right piece!
22	48	The...	
22	48	Ones with the...	
22	48	Edges, right?	
22	48		
22	48		Yeah
22	48	Yeah, we should try and find the edges	
22	48		I'm thirsty
22	48	Okay, go see in the- in the bag, see if you've got some #	
22	48		Mom what is this?
22	48	Not ours to touch

22	48	It's like a mouse, yeah. Come on over let's put the puzzle together, come on	
22	48	There's your water	
22	48	Alright, let's find the edges, okay?	
22	48	No, come over here please, have a seat	
22	48		Can I put it? ####
22	48		Can I ### see through that one # when I'm done
22	48	We'll have to ask. We'll ask them, okay?	
22	48	Come on, help me turn them- puzzle pieces over	
22	48		Why were they be... in... next door?
22	48	Okay

22	48	Do those go together?	
22	48	Oh, we're missing pieces	
22	48	There's pieces under there	
22	48	'Kay	
22	48	I remember this guy was down here somewhere	
22	48	Oh there we go	
22	48	Maybe he wasn't down there, maybe her was up there	
22	48	What do ya think?	
22	48	Are you gonna do any?	
22	48	Why don't you start putting the piece togeth- the puzzle together?	
22	48		I- I stopped putting the puzzle together to drink my water
22	48	*laughing* You sure did. That's okay	
22	48	I wonder if we could find a corner piece	
22	48		I- Where's the toys?
22	48	I don't know	
22	48	Hey, is this one a corner piece?	
22	48		Mmm yes

22	48	'Bout that one? Yeah, where does that one go, you think?	
22	48		Um
22	48		Hmm
22	48	uh uh	
22	48		Maybe somewhere around the butterfly
22	48	Where, maybe up here?	
22	48	Mmm	
22	48		Mmm, maybe
22	48	Maybe we're not ready for that piece	
22	48	Ooh, What about this one?	
22	48	That goes there, huh?	
22	48		Mm-hmm
22	48	That's an edge piece, right?	
22	48	Nope, that doesn't work	
22	48	Hmm	
22	48	*gasp*	
22	48	Does that go there?	
22	48		Think it does
22	48	Sorta looks like it might, doesn't it?	
22	48	What else? Where else is there blue butterfly? What about that one?	
22	48	Does that have blue butterfly?	
22	48	Ooh, does that go?	
22	48		Yep!
22	48	It does, but hmm. Is that right? Is that how a nose goes?	
22	48		No
22	48	No, so we gotta turn it. Will you turn it so that it's facing the right way?	
22	48	No I think it's together, it's # the right way, but maybe this is in the wrong corner	
22	48	Maybe we should turn the puzzle	
22	48	Maybe it needs to go like that, huh?	
22	48	Yeah, ##	
22	48		
22	48		Think you're right, mama
22	48	There's part of the butterfly, where's that go?	
22	48		Think you're right
22	48		
22	48	Oh, good job, there you go	
22	48		What- What's that on the butterfly?
22	48	Oh, that's not quite right though, is it?	
22	48		What's that on the butterfly?
22	48	I don't know, but that one was not quite right	
22	48	What's that?	
22	48		A tiger
22	48	Hmm	
22	48		A tiger it's a tiger
22	48	That's not a tiger	
22	48		It's a tiger
22	48	Here, come on, start putting some pieces together. Oh look, Hey- What's that?	
22	48		###
22	48		A leopard
22	48	Yeah, what else is- what- but what part of the leopard?	
22	48		The, uh, eye
22	48	The eye, that's right	
22	48		The eye part of the leopard
22	48	Yeah	
22	48	So where does the eye part of- go usually?	
22	48		*gasp*
22	48	Above or below the nose?	
22	48		I found... A piece- some part of the butterfly
22	48		But it doesn't go there
22	48	Well try it, try it again, maybe it does. *gasp* You're right, it doesn't	
22	48	'Cause that's not butterfly, right?	
22	48	#	
22	48		Yeah but there's a part, butterfly in- on the edge
22	48	Yeah, let's see	
22	48	Here look at this	
22	48		Can you push me in?
22	48	Yeah, of course, buddy	
22	48		*noises*
22	48	What's that part? Yeah, there you go	
22	48		
22	48	Hmm	
22	48	Okay, what else?	
22	48	You think maybe this'll fit in there now?	
22	48	Hmm	
22	48	No, it just doesn't, does it?	
22	48	Let's see, what else can we find of that leopard?	
22	48	Hmm	
22	48		What was that noise?
22	48	I don't know	
22	48		*noises*
22	48		Hmm, nope!
22	48	Hmm	
22	48		That piece goes in like that, I think
22	48		Hmm, maybe not
22	48	Mmm, here's more leopard	
22	48	Are we missing some leopard?	
22	48	Oh, see we're missing some leopard, here	
22	48	There's another eyes	
22	48	There we go, now we got all the eyes	
22	48	There you go!	
22	48		
22	48	That's looking good, and look there's butterfly on that one!	
22	48		
22	48	Do you think they match up?	
22	48		Yep!
22	48	So what about that piece? Does that piece match up over there?	
22	48		*noises*
22	48	What do you think? Why don't you push it together?	
22	48	It did! It did!	
22	48	So	
22	48		
22	48	That does go there. How come it didn't work before? That was really weird	
22	48	Okay, what about, *gasp* Is that right?	
22	48		
22	48		Yep!
22	48	Yep	
22	48	Oh, look at this piece, Oh, look at that!	
22	48		
22	48	Good job	
22	48		Uhh, that one was a little bit tricky
22	48	That one was a little tricky	
22	48	I'm looking for another piece though, we're missing a piece	
22	48	That would go right there	
22	48	*gasp* maybe	
22	48	Look at that	
22	48	Why do I think that might work? What's shape- Does it match that shape? 	
22	48		Um, I think so. It sure does. Hey! That looks like part of a cow!
22	48	You see the hole?	
22	48		
22	48	Yeah, sure does	
22	48		
22	48	Look at that	
22	48	Sure does. Hey, look, does that fit in that spot right there?	
22	48		*noises*
22	48		
22	48	It does	
22	48		What's that?
22	48	Looks like a leaf, a pretty flower, doe- Isn't it?	
22	48		*noises*
22	48	Hmm, this looks like part of the cat, maybe, it's the rest of his what?	
22	48		
22	48		That... a leopard
22	48	Oh sorry, the leopard, what's- What part of that, is it?	
22	48		Umm, His ear
22	48	*laughing* His ear	
22	48		Now, let's see if this fits here
22	48	Oh, nope	
22	48		Mmm
22	48	Yeah, we know that fits together	
22	48	What about this over here?	
22	48	Now I remember the ants were kind of in- down below here somewhere	
22	48	Do you remember that?	
22	48		No
22	48	No?	
22	48	What do we think that is? Is that- that's the toucan's #?	
22	48		Yeah
22	48	Yeah? Here, hold on, is that part of the toucan?	
22	48		Yep
22	48		That's part of the toucan
22	48	Hmm, maybe that toucan doesn't belong up here	
22	48	Maybe he's over here somewhere or something, I don't know	
22	48	Mmm, *gasp* Does that # go together?	
22	48	No	
22	48	Hmm. Oh, here's a spot	
22	48	Try it-	
22	48		
22	48		That's a leopard
22	48	Yeah	
22	48		Uh
22	48	Oh, what does that look like?	
22	48		Mmm, a butterfly
22	48	No	
22	48		Um, a-
22	48	Frog toe?	
22	48	Toes?	
22	48		Mmm, Uhh, it looks like a tree frog
22	48		
22	48	*gasp*	
22	48	Yeah! So let's find more frog stuff	
22	48	There's some frog things over there. Let's see if we can find more frogs	
22	48		
22	48	*gasp* look at that	
22	48		Is that a tree frog?
22	48	Yeah	
22	48	I think it is	
22	48	That doesn't go there. Maybe we'll put him over here	
22	48	Where- Okay let's look for more frogs	
22	48		I found a little baby frog
22	48	Yeah? So let's see if you can find a place for him- that baby frog to go	
22	48		Hmm
22	48		
22	48	Where else?	
22	48	Oh, I bet this-	
22	48	Goes *gasp* Look!	
22	48		
22	48	*gasp*	
22	48	Does that work?	
22	48		Yep
22	48	What's that?	
22	48		Looks like a crocodile
22	48	W- Are crocodiles in the trees?	
22	48		No
22	48	No, what's- can live in trees?	
22	48		Um, snakes can
22	48	Yeah, let's see if we can find more snake	
22	48	*gasp*	
22	48	Oh, that looks good	
22	48	Yeah, maybe make more room, for that- there you go	
22	48		
22	48	Yeah, here look at this piece	
22	48	Where does that look like it might fit?	
22	48	Yeah, look at that	
22	48		
22	48	So, cool	
22	48		Mommy what is that? Hanging in the trees?
22	48	Oh, what hangs in the trees? That move really, really slow?	
22	48		Monkeys wo- Well, monkeys hang in the trees from vines
22	48	They do, but what else? What could this be?	
22	48		
22	48		Um a sloth
22	48	A sloth, that's right	
22	48		What's a sloth?
22	48	That	
22	48	Alright, what else? What else are we missing? Here, hold on *gasp* Look, does that toe match that toe?	
22	48		
22	48	It does	
22	48	What about this?	
22	48	What about this one? Do you think that one matches that?	
22	48		Mmm
22	48	*noises*	
22	48		*noises* Ouch
22	48	*noises* It worked!	
22	48	Ouch? What's that?	
22	48		Um... I think this- that's part of a termite
22	48	Termite?	
22	48	Or is it an ant?	
22	48		It's a termite
22	48	A termite? Alright, well where do we think those go?	
22	48		Hmm
22	48	Oh, I think you might be right	
22	48		
22	48	Yep	
22	48		That was tricky
22	48	That is tricky. This might not be the- where it's supposed to go, so try that	
22	48		
22	48	Then I wonder, if this actually is supposed to be down here	
22	48	'Cause look at that	
22	48	Does that look like it matches?	
22	48	No I think you were right, I think that goes in a corner	
22	48	No, not that corner, this corner	
22	48	Right down there	
22	48	Yeah try that there	
22	48		
22	48		
22	48		Uhh
22	48	There we go, okay	
22	48		Mommy, that-
22	48	Now we're good	
22	48		Mommy what is that thing carrying?
22	48		
22	48	So what do you think, what do we think, does that # go there?	
22	48		
22	48	Yes	
22	48		
22	48		
22	48	Oh, look at that!	
22	48	Oh wait, look at those over there	
22	48	That matches tho- that tree frog	
22	48	Yeah, it's gotta go s- up there somewhere	
22	48		Hmm
22	48	Hmm	
22	48	How 'bout- Keep going, I think it still goes there. Keep working it out	
22	48	I think that- I think that's where it goes	
22	48	Keep spinning it, maybe it's gotta- you know you gotta keep turning it, so the pinks match	
22	48	Yeah, there you go	
22	48		
22	48		Oh oh
22	48	Oh look at that!	
22	48		Where is the toys?
22	48	*laughing* After we do the puzzles, dude	
22	48		Where'd they put the toys?
22	48	I don't know	
22	48	Come on, let's-	
22	48		Maybe they put the toys in the playroom
22	48	Maybe	
22	48		'Cause toys are always in the play- are in playrooms
22	48		
22	48		
22	48	Maybe, maybe it goes like literally right there. And we just don't have pieces for it yet	
22	48	So let's see if we can find- Is there any other piece of that? Yeah, maybe there. Nope, that doesn't look good	
22	48		*humming*
22	48	I'm still trying to figure out where the rest of that snake is	
22	48		
22	48	Ooh, look I found a place for the bird	
22	48		
22	48	*gasp* There's the snake, you found it!	
22	48		
22	48	Oh, look at that	
22	48	Oh look, maybe try this one, in here somewhere?	
22	48	Looks like it should go there somewhere, doesn't it?	
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Maybe try it so the yellow and yellow?	
22	48	See how the yellow's there? So where would the yellow go? to match with the bird	
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Yeah, like that!	
22	48	Try it	
22	48		
22	48	Does that work? Oh it does!	
22	48	Oh look, you know what? I think I'm holding on to the rest of the snake. Look at that. Wanna put it in?	
22	48		*humming*
22	48		
22	48		*humming*
22	48		
22	48	Wanna push the rest of that one in or no?	
22	48	*gasp*	
22	48	No no no, I think- keep going- try it up- keep trying it up here. Oh, ### you're right. It's down there	
22	48		
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Give me five!	
22	48	Good job! Here, we got a piece over here	
22	48		I'm- I- I'm rubbing my eyes
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Oh I think you're right. Keep it up there, I think you're right	
22	48	What does that toucan have in his mouth?	
22	48		A berry
22	48		
22	48	A berry?	
22	48		Maybe he's planning- eating the berry
22	48	Maybe he is planning on eating the berry	
22	48	Hmm, maybe try down here?	
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Nope, that doesn't work	
22	48		
22	48		*humming*
22	48	*gasp* That does work! There ya go	
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Oh yeah, keep- keep trying that one up- I think that's a good-	
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Think that might work- *gasp* Oh look at that	
22	48		
22	48	Oh, where are the mushrooms?	
22	48		*humming*
22	48	Keep looking, over there, yeah there!	
22	48		
22	48		What's that one all covered with?
22	48	Moss and mushrooms	
22	48	Oh, where's this ant go?	
22	48		Termite
22	48	It's a ant-	
22	48	Termite?	
22	48		Yeah. What's it carrying in it's mouth?
22	48	It's trying to eat a mushroom	
22	48	So if that's part of the mushroom- I don't know	
22	48		What's it carry- In it's mouth?
22	48		
22	48	A leaf?	
22	48	I think, those are like, leaf-cutter ants. We're missing a piece! Where's the last piece?	
22	48		Uhh, huh
22	48	Did we drop it on the floor?	
22	48		There it is!
22	48	Oh! Go get it!	
22	48	How'd it get all the way over there?	
22	48		I don't know
22	48		What- It- What's that green stuff on the log?
22	48		
22	48		
22	48	Moss	
22	48		What's moss?
22	48	Green stuff that grows on logs	
22	48	*laughing*	
22	48		What is it?
22	48	It's a very simple plant	
22	48		But is it yucky?
22	48	No	
22	48	'Member from our book? "The weeds and tender mosses"	
22	48	went next	
22	48	what book is that from?	
22	48		I don't know
22	48	Yeah you do	
22	48		What?
22	48	The weeds and the hearty plants went first	
22	48	The tender mosses, went second	
22	48		The... The curious garden
22	48	*laughing* yeah that's right	
22	48		Are- Can you play with the toys yet?
22	48	Not yet. Do you wanna pop your head out and tell her we're done?	
22	48	Go open the door	
22	48		
22	48	And say "we finished!"	
22	48	###	
22	24		
22	24	Ooh	
22	24	We should look at this one more closely so we have an idea what goes where, what do you think?	
22	24		Is she going back to next door?
22	24	Yep	
22	24	What do you think? Let's try and remember what goes in what corner	
22	24		
22	24		Mmm
22	24	So, what's that?	
22	24		A starfish
22	24	What's over here?	
22	24		Umm, is that a giant squid?
22	24	I don't think so	
22	24	I like the way you think, though	
22	24	It's a big... huge...	
22	24		Stingray
22	24	No	
22	24		Octopus
22	24	No, it doesn't have any arms. It's a big, huge- it brings air	
22	24	It's one of the biggest mammals, in the water	
22	24		What is it?
22	24	What- what is- what are the big, huge, whal- mam- mammals in the water?	
22	24		I don't know
22	24	I almost spilled the beans	
22	24		
22	24	What is it?	
22	24	It's a W-	
22	24		Whale
22	24	Whale. What's that one?	
22	24		Um, a jellyfish
22	24	A jellyfish, and then what's over here in this corner?	
22	24		Uhh, shark!

22	24	What's that one?	
22	24	What's that one? You know that one	
22	24		Mommy that shark is trying t- o eat up that swordfish
22	24	He might be. What's that one?	
22	24		But I think that swordfish will be able to kill him!
22	24	You think so?	
22	24		Yeah, with his sword
22	24	Aww, maybe they're friends. Maybe  they're playing tag. What's that one?	
22	24		A octopus
22	24	What's that?

22	24		I'm gonna go take a peek
22	24	No. We'll take a peek when we're done	
22	24	What was in this corner?

25	48	### How 'bout over here, maybe?	
25	48	*gasp* What about right here?	
25	48	That part of the toucan's beak?	
25	48		
25	48		It is the part of the toucan's beak
25	48		Where does this one go?
25	48	Let's see, what piece is- What does is look like?	
25	48	Oh look, NAME, there's a little bit of blue here, where is- is there some blue?	
25	48	By the toucan's beak maybe?	
25	48	Does the blue fit there?	
25	48	###	
25	48		
25	48	Okay, we're doing good	
25	48		Mmm
25	48	Oh, what is that? Is that part of the frog's foot?	
25	48		Mmm
25	48		
25	48	Very good	
25	48		Where this go?
25	48		It goes right ###
25	48		Crocodile
25	48		Might go right here
25	48	Is that part of the red flower?	
25	48		
25	48		###
25	48	### snake, yeah	
25	48	Do you see more of the snake?	
25	48		### just a crocodile
25	48		Might go here?
25	48	Or is that part of the toucan?	
25	48	The bird	
25	48	Where do you think this part goes? This yellow?	
25	48	Where's the yellow?	
25	48		
25	48	Good	
25	48		Where does this go?
25	48	I think you're gonna get it	
25	48		
25	48	### We're getting so close to being done	
25	48		
25	48	Look at there's red here, where else is there red?	
25	48		
25	48		Only two more pieces
25	48		
25	48		
25	48		
25	48	Who did it?	
25	48		Ah- Both of us! Now I wanna change out of ###
25	48	###	
25	48	Do you wanna go tell *name* we're finished?	
25	48		### I get a shirt?
25	48	I don't know, let's go tell *name* we're finished first, okay? And then she'll tell us what this- the plan is	
25	48	She's right over in the other room	
25	48		
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
26	24		
26	24	Alright	
26	24		No, don't turn them over
26	24	Well, I gotta take them apart, right?	
26	24		
26	24	### what the picture looks like?	
26	24		Where?
26	24	That the puzzle's gonna make	
26	24		Where's the example thing?
26	24	Hmm, I think look it's right here. See? What does that say?	
26	24		Under the sea
26	24	Yep. Under the sea. It's gonna look like this	
26	24	Let's do it!	
26	24	Hop up there. Or do you wanna be in my lap?	
26	24	What do you think? Chair or lap?	
26	24		
26	24		A chair
26	24	Okay	
26	24	So-	
26	24		I love these chairs
26	24	They are comfortable chairs	
26	24		Because I can- this
26	24	Show me	
26	24	It spins all the way around	
26	24	Alright. Look	
26	24		How do  you make it spin?
26	24	Oh you just push! But sh- can you do the puzzle with me now?	
26	24	Yeah, roll in more scoot your hiney in there. And there we go	
26	24	Okay	
26	24	So	
26	24	Hey! Let's do the puzzle	
26	24	Can you find the corner pieces?	
26	24	It's always just ### first place to start, right?	
26	24		What's that do?
26	24	Uh, these are adjustments to move the chair around- uh, up and down, uh, we don't wanna play with those	
26	24		Why?
26	24	Uh, because these aren't our chairs	
26	24		No, you don't move it
26	24	Sorry. Alright can you find the corner pieces so we can get started on this?	
26	24		*noises* Can you find the corner pieces?
26	24	Well this is a corner piece, you're right there. And I think there's another one right next to it. Wanna find it?	
26	24	No, not that. That's an edge piece but that's not a corner piece	
26	24	Yeah, there's another corner piece	
26	24	And I see another one	
26	24		Sick of getting them out
26	24	You want me to get it?	
26	24		Yeah
26	24	Okay	
26	24		###
26	24	Oh, don't go over there. NAME. Don't go over there	
26	24		Why?
26	24	I don't want you to knock anything over. Come on back	
26	24	NAME	
26	24	Alright. I see one more corner piece. Can you see the other corner piece?	
26	24		That's because a square has four cor- Because a rectangle has four corners!
26	24		
26	24	 Yep! Do you see the ### four- the other one?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	I see it. Your hand's right next to it	
26	24	Okay	
26	24	Let's look at that picture again so we can remember which corner piece goes where	
26	24	Alright, so it looks like-	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Let's see, where ### this corner piece is gonna go. Yeah. And how 'bout this one?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Okay. And this one?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	And so this one must go- right. Okay	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	So we know this is gonna go there	
26	24	And this is gonna go there	
26	24	And right here, ### Alright. Let's see if we can fill in these edges, okay?	
26	24		
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Let's see, can you see a piece that might connect to any of these?	
26	24	### some edge pieces	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Let's get the edges out	
26	24	Okay, here look	
26	24	I pulled out the edge pieces	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Which of these pieces fits on one of these?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24		That's the sound of all of the steam coming out of the spout
26	24	###	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Could those two pieces fit together?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Is it gonna be possible for those two pieces to fit together? Look at the edges	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Look at the edges	
26	24		No
26	24	No. Why not?	
26	24		*noises* Because *noises* This is too big for this
26	24		
26	24	That's true. But also, look	
26	24		It's ###
26	24	The edges don't match up. The edges are gonna have to be in the same-	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	###	
26	24	Wait a minute. Look at that again	
26	24	Maybe those pieces do fit together	
26	24	If we line up the edges, maybe something will- *gasp* Alright, where do you think that should go?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Don't know quite yet. Alright, let's keep- let's keep going	
26	24	Oh	
26	24	Oh yeah, very nice	
26	24	Good job	
26	24	Okay	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Let's see if we can build off of this stuff. Do you see something that might connect right here? Help make this fish? It's a shark, right?	
26	24	Okay, what's next? We've got a s- this funny thing here. Do you see another piece that's got a funny thing that might connect to that?	
26	24	This one? Okay	
26	24	Let's try it out	
26	24	Excellent. Alright. What's gonna help complete that swordfish?	
26	24	No, it's not gonna do that	
26	24	Then there'd be nothing over here	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Plus, I don't think that jellyfish had a swordfish eye	
26	24	What's gonna help complete that swordfish?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24		
26	24	Do you see something that looks like the- like the rest of that fish?	
26	24		###
26	24	I do	
26	24	Do you see?	
26	24		I ### my chair forward
26	24		*noises*
26	24	What about this piece	
26	24		Don't hold it
26	24	What a- What about this piece?	
26	24		*noises* No
26	24	What do you think? Can this go right here?	
26	24	No	
26	24	This one?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	No	
26	24	Maybe that one. Let's find out	
26	24		
26	24	Hey, look at that. Oh so we need- there's gonna be one piece that fits right here	
26	24	You see the piece that does that?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	One of these	
26	24		
26	24	Hey. Alright. We got two sides done, let's see if we can get the other two done	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	So what's gonna be on the bottom here?	
26	24	### gonna come down	
26	24	Oh, This is a jellyfish, right? What's gonna help- make that jellyfish complete? Do you see the rest of that jellyfish anywhere?	
26	24		*noises* 
26	24		*noises*
26	24	It doesn't go there	
26	24		Why?
26	24	Well, look	
26	24	This is a corner piece. It has to go in the corner, right?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	So what do you see that might ### finish this jellyfish?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24		*noises* Do you ever ### confused at corner pieces sometimes go ###
26	24	Sure, everyone gets confused ### sometimes	
26	24		*noises* What?
26	24	Puzzles are tricky	
26	24	Let's see. I said puzzles are tricky	
26	24	What's gonna help make this jellyfish ### complete? Which one of these pieces might fit- might hook onto that jellyfish	
26	24		*noises*
26	24		
26	24	I know, this one	
26	24		
26	24		*noises*
26	24	No, not that one? Well which one then?	
26	24		I need my chair forward, not pick a piece
26	24	Well, you gotta stop scooting back	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	What's the next piece?	
26	24	Why don't you look at the pieces?	
26	24	I think we should do...	
26	24	This one	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	### doesn't work	
26	24	Which one will work?	
26	24	Hmm? ###	
26	24		That was the sound- uh, of all the steam blowing out of the engine
26	24	Does it need more water?	
26	24		No
26	24	Oh, okay	
26	24		It was just the steam coming out
26	24	Oh, okay	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	I noticed something interesting. This piece- look	
26	24	You ### these two pieces connecting?	
26	24	And	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	What about this? Something strange about this	
26	24	Okay, well hey. We've got all- we've got three out of the four sides done. Let's ### that means that all of these pieces are gonna go here	
26	24		
26	24	See how fast you can put 'em in	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	But remember, you gotta put 'em in right	
26	24	What about-	
26	24	Whoa	
26	24	Well that's not gonna go there	
26	24		###
26	24	It's gonna- It's not- No, it's gotta go this way because of the edge, right?	
26	24		'Kay
26	24	But it's not gonna go here, because there's nothing for it to connect to, ### not gonna go here, 'cause there's nothing for it to connect to. So it's gonna be somewhere in the middle here	
26	24	But	
26	24		But you said, everything would be here
26	24	Everything is gonna be on the edge, it's gonna be somewhere on this edge, but something else is gonna be here and something else is gonna be here. Can you figure out?	
26	24	Fast as you can	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Hey, careful!	
26	24	Where does this one go?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Does- does it connect to here?	
26	24	Watch the edge	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	I think I see a piece that might connect to it but I'm not sure	
26	24	Well, you know it's gonna be on this edge, right? So it's either this piece or this piece or this piece. Make sure you line the edge up and see if it fits somewhere	
26	24		*noises*
26	24		*noises*
26	24	### it doesn't fit there	
26	24	Could fit there?	
26	24		
26	24	Aha! It does	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Do you see another- Alright we need- Does this piece fit on there?	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	Look at the picture	
26	24	No. Do you see a piece that does fit here?	
26	24		###
26	24		*noises*
26	24	One of these two pieces	
26	24	### you gotta line up the edge ###	
26	24		*noises*
26	24		
26	24		
26	24	Okay, well, you only got one piece left for the edge, so you know where it's gotta go, right?	
26	24		
26	24	Alright. Now these are the pieces that go in the middle	
26	24	So, let's see if we can figure out where they go	
26	24		We made the frame
26	24	We did make the frame, and, it looks like this might be the easiest place to start, 'cause this- this octopus looks pretty, uh, pretty distinct. Can you see pieces of the octopus in here?	
26	24		Lots of them
26	24	Well, put 'em in	
26	24	See if it fits, see if you can make 'em fit	
26	24		
26	24	excellent	
26	24		*noises*
26	24		
26	24	Okay, Hey, and you made some more of this- uh, What is that, an anemone? I'm not sure, Is that an anemone?	
26	24		###
26	24	I don't know what the name of that- polyp	
26	24	It's just- I don't remember the name of that	
26	24		
26	24	But I don't think that quite fits there	
26	24	Maybe if we rotate it	
26	24		*noises*
26	24	No, 'cause it doesn't have that purple. Right? Is there somewhere ### the purple?	
26	24	Do you see the purple from the anemone ### I don't know what the name of that	
26	24	Can you line the purple up on this?	
26	24		And what?
26	24	### this, in this piece. You see the purple in this piece?	
26	24	Yeah. There we go	
26	24		
26	24	Alright, what's next?	
26	24	Oh, that's part of the crab	
26	24		
26	24	Okay. Hey we only have four pieces left	
26	24	You see anything that might connect with the shark?	
26	24		
26	24	Okay	
26	24	Where's this gonna go?	
26	24		
26	24	Oh, with the shark's nose, okay	
26	24		Where's this ###
26	24		###
26	24	Well, you only got two places	
26	24	Two places it can go	
26	24	And, I don't think that's one of the two. I uh- I don't think that's- that- Oh, wait, wait, look	
26	24	See this green?	
26	24	Does that green line up at all with this?	
26	24		Yeah!
26	24	Okay, but we might need to rotate it	
26	24	Hey, there we go	
26	24		
26	24	Which means this must go here, right?	
26	24		Yeah
26	24		
26	24		
26	24	Okay! There we go. Let's go tell them that we're done with this puzzle and we need the next one. Alright?	
26	24		Okay. I will tell them. Not you. I can. You don't need to come
26	24	Okay	
26	24		
26	24	*laughing* Okay, you tell them	
26	24	That means more fun	
26	24	Okay, let's get a good look at this picture	
26	48		
26	48	See how it looks	
26	48	We're gonna have a butterfly down here, and, what's gonna be in this corner? *gasp* What's that?	
26	48		A frog
26	48	And in this corner?	
26	48		
26	48		I don't know, flowers
26	48	Flowers, yeah. And this corner?	
26	48		Flowers
26	48	I think it might be like a f- a red-leafed fern, or something like that. Alright, let's do it	
26	48	Can you help take the pieces apart?	
26	48		This is how I do it
26	48	Mmkay	
26	48		What?
26	48	I said Okay	
26	48		
26	48	What are you doing?	
26	48	Come on, let's do the puzzle	
26	48		
26	48	Come on, let's do the puzzle	
26	48	Come on, sweetie. Let's do the puzzle	
26	48	Do you want to be on my lap this time when we- while we do the puzzle? I'd like that	
26	48		
26	48	Alright. Can you help me find the, uh, the corner pieces?	
26	48		###
26	48	No, you gotta leave that stuff alone	
26	48		Why?
26	48	It's not our stuff	
26	48	Can you help me find the corner pieces?	
26	48		Well then we should leave this one
26	48	We should what?	
26	48		Leave this one
26	48	No, they asked us to play with this	
26	48	So we gotta- we gotta find the corner pieces. Do you see those- any of the corner pieces?	
26	48	What do you think, you see a corner piece?	
26	48	I see a corner piece	
26	48		Where?
26	48		Is it here?
26	48	That's the one I saw!	
26	48	So you wanna- Do you know where it goes?	
26	48	No, this is where the red- the- the red-leafed fern goes	
26	48	This is where the flowers go, this is where the frog goes, so I think it must be down here	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	The butterfly goes down here	
26	48	Oh, hey, frog. The frog that ### Look	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	### the frog ### upside-down	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	That's where the ### red leafed fern goes	
26	48	Frog goes up there	
26	48	Then, hey	
26	48	Red-leafed fern	
26	48	And	
26	48		Red-leafed fern
26	48	No, the blue flowers go up here. Or are they pink flowers? I think they're pink- yep. Pink flowers. Here we go	
26	48	Okay, we got the corner pieces? Let's get the edge pieces out. Can you help me pull the edge pieces out?	
26	48		
26	48		That's purple
26	48	Yes you're right	
26	48	Can you help me pull the edge pieces out? So we can start lining them in	
26	48	What do you think, could you help me do that?	
26	48		*noises* 
26	48	Hey, would you help me?	
26	48	Can you help me please?	
26	48		###
26	48		*noises* Look
26	48	I'd really like your help	
26	48		Look
26	48	Yeah I see. It rained a lot and our shoes got a little bit wet. It's okay	
26	48	Alright. I think I got all the corner pieces, so now our job is-	
26	48		There is all the corner pieces
26	48	Yeah, I think I've got- I'm sorry. You're right. I think I've got all the edge pieces here, so now our job is to put the edges together. Can you help me do that?	
26	48	Oh no. We're gonna leave that door alone. Leave that door alone	
26	48		
26	48		
26	48		Why?
26	48	'Cause we gotta do this now. Alright, we gotta put this- put the edges together. So, I think it might be easiest to start with the red-leafed fern 'cause it's very distinctive. Can you find some more of the red-leafed fern?	
26	48	What do you think? Find some more of the red-leafed fern?	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	Remember the edge has to line up	
26	48	Well it doesn't connect directly to one of those, so let's leave it here for the time being. Do you see some more of the ### that might connect directly to this?	
26	48		Daddy
26	48	###	
26	48	Gotta leave- leave the table alone	
26	48		Why?
26	48	Do you wanna be on my lap?	
26	48		
26	48	Would that be more comfy?	
26	48	What do you think?	
26	48		This is comfy
26	48	Okay, well you gotta help me with this now, right?	
26	48		And remember, you- The video camera is taking a video of you
26	48	Yeah. That's okay	
26	48		Everyone will know, right? ### other people will know what you do
26	48	*laughing*	
26	48	Yeah. That's okay	
26	48	Can you help me put this red fern- uh, this red-leafed fern together?	
26	48	You see pieces that might connect to the red-leafed fern?	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	I see something	
26	48	But maybe- Now this one won't, right? But-	
26	48	These might	
26	48	Right?	
26	48	###	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	But the edges don't line up	
26	48		###
26	48	Well what about maybe up here somewhere	
26	48	Okay. Does that connect? Yeah that connects. Okay	
26	48	So looks like we- we've got- we need to look for a pieces that might have the top of the red-leafed fern. Right?	
26	48		Yeah, you do that
26	48	Why do I do that? Why don't we do that together?	
26	48		You do that
26	48	You want me to do it? Why?	
26	48		###
26	48	Is this boring?	
26	48		Yeah
26	48	Well, I want you to help me anyway, okay?	
26	48		No
26	48	Now remember	
26	48		What?
26	48		W- What?
26	48	Need your help	
26	48	I think this piece goes here. What do you think?	
26	48	Oh, this looks like we should be able to fit it- fit this together very easily. Do you see a piece that's got this kind of curvy, uh, uh, orange?	
26	48		No but I see a pie- It's not curvy
26	48	Well see if that fits in	
26	48	Oh yeah, I bet maybe that's a petal for a flower	
26	48	Okay	
26	48		For flower, it's a flower
26	48	Yeah. Okay. Now what's gonna go up here, then? We got some more of that-	
26	48		It must be a forest puzzle
26	48	I think you're right	
26	48	So it looks like we're looking for something that-	
26	48	That can continue this- this petal up	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	Can you help me find that?	
26	48	Hey, I think I found it	
26	48		What?
26	48	What do you think, does this fit there?	
26	48		Like that
26	48	Hey look and it's got part of the- the- the- p- purple flowers up here. Okay. We got one whole s- one whole side. Let's get the other sides. No no no. No the sides stay here. Let's get the other sides	
26	48		*noises*
26	48		### just playing
26	48	*laughing* Oh, okay, you play	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	Here I'll hold this	
26	48	You're being so silly	
26	48		*noises*
26	48		
26	48	That- um, This frog, that red looks pretty distinctive. ### be able to find more that's got that red. You see anything else here in the edge pieces that have a red like that?	
26	48		
26	48	I do	
26	48	Do you see any pieces that have a red like that?	
26	48	Here. Look at the pieces	
26	48		
26	48		Do you have memory cards in your computer?
26	48	Not in my computer, I have different- uh, they- it stores information differently than um, with a memory card. It's got discs that- uh, it stores information on. ### magnetic discs	
26	48		Yeah, and sometimes you need to ### put more memory inside?
26	48	Um, yeah you could take it out and replace it	
26	48		With the more memory?
26	48	Yeah	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	Alright. Do you see anything else that might fit with this- this distinctive sort of maroon red	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	Over here	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	So I think-	
26	48	These pieces look like they might fit with it somehow	
26	48		Try to remember where the maroon red is
26	48	It right up here, under your hand	
26	48	What do you think- Can- Does one of these- May- Hey- Maybe one of these three pieces fits on to that puzzle piece. What do you think?

26	48	Can you see if any of these pieces fit onto that piece and into this corner?	
26	48		*noises* Do these fit together?
26	48	Can you do that for me please?	
26	48	Well, no. 'Cause those are both corner

26	48	I can't tell myself because you're covering ### with your hand	
26	48		*noises*
26	48	Can you find out for me? If one of those pieces will fit?	
26	48	Oh, remember we gotta line up the edge

27	24		So he jumped! Popeye jumped
27	24	Okay, once upon a time	
27	24	Once upon a time	
27	24		Read Popeye story
27	24	I don't wanna read Popeye, I wanna tell you my story	
27	24	Okay, once upon a time, in the big green ocean	
27	24	There was a tiny tiny bubble	
27	24	And the tiny bubble was very afraid, because in this- in the- in the, um, ocean, there were all kind of animals that were trying- that could hurt the bubble, and the bubble was very delicate, so he wanted to find a way to get to the top, so he could bust open and fly up in the air, and get away, but everywhere he looked in the ocean was someth-	
27	24		This little bubble?
27	24	We can make him him. So everywhere he looked in the ocean, there was someth-	
27	24		He found his daddy!
27	24	Gotta listen, you gotta listen. Everywhere he looked in the ocean there was something very deadly. There were- to the right of him there were big mean, huge crabs that could squish him with his claws. To the left of him was a seahorse that could stomp on him, if he bumped into him, and then right in front of him was a big huge swordfish, who he is very afraid of because his long pointy beak can poke him, and he'd bust open into the water	
27	24	And then there was the mean old shark. He just wanted to eat anything and everything. So poor Mr.- So poor Mr. Bubble didn't have any place to go to get to the top so he could bust open and get into the air and escape!	
27	24		What about this?
27	24	So he thought, 'Wow, what am I gonna do?' So one day, Mr. Bubble floated on the bottom of Mr. Crabs, and he floated all the way over, past the purple, *noises* anenome, all the way over to, the starfish, and he knew the starfish had gone away to visit his cousin so the shell was empty. So Mr. Bubble hid underneath the starfish shell until all of the bad guys, and all the bad animals went away for lunch and to go play	
27	24	Then when the coast was clear, he hurried up, and he popped out of the starfish, out of the hole- out of the hole in the starfish, and he floated to the top, and when he got to the top, he saw the air, and he busted open and flew up in the air, and he lived happily ever after. The end. Wasn't that cool?	
27	24		####

28	24	See if you can figure out how to rotate it so it fits in	
28	24	I don't think that fits	
28	24	Try it again. Try to rotate it a different direction	
28	24	No, that's doesn't fit. Rotate it again, that means move it sideways

3	24		###
3	24	This is like that Dora puzzle	
3	24	That auntie *name* got you	
3	24		
3	24	You have to mix all the pieces up, you can't just keep 'em in order.	
3	24		Why do-
3	24	Remember that Dora puzzle that auntie *name* got you? It's kinda wooden like this.	
3	24		Yep
3	24	I put the pieces away	
3	24		Why?
3	24	So you wouldn't lose 'em	
3	24	It's like four different puzzles	
3	24		More like 5 different puzzles
3	24	Okay	
3	24		Now
3	24	What do you want to start with?	
3	24		Hmm
3	24	We gotta mix 'em up, mix 'em up, mix 'em up, mix 'em up	
3	24		No
3	24	You don't wanna mix 'em up?	
3	24		I don't know that
3	24		Okay
3	24	See	
3	24		I don't wanna mix 'em up
3	24	I don't think that goes with that	
3	24	Look for something with green	
3	24		Okay
3	24	See like I think this goes	
3	24	Maybe	
3	24		
3	24	Yeah, that goes together.	
3	24	Can you stick those in the corner?	
3	24	The bottom corner	
3	24	Aah	
3	24		
3	24	Okay, Yeah	
3	24		Where's this?
3	24	Nope

3	24	Ooh, wait, look	
3	24	Nope	
3	24		It do fit
3	24		See look
3	24	No, that doesn't fit	
3	24	Look at the colors	
3	24	I think this goes up here somewhere	
3	24		I think this goes
3	24	Up at the top, see?	
3	24		What's that? A jellyfish something?
3	24	Uhh I think that this doesn't go here.	
3	24		Yes it do, Ma
3	24		
3	24	No it doesn't. You have to look for something with light blue, like that.	
3	24	Maybe this	
3	24		Yea
3	24	Hmm I don't know	
3	24	Naw, that doesn't go either	
3	24		Yes it do
3	24	I think it goes up here somewhere.	
3	24	Maybe	
3	24		###
3	24	Naw, it doesn't go up there either	
3	24		###
3	24	This is what we'll do	
3	24	Let's try to put the top together first	
3	24		
3	24		Okay
3	24	I think that, yeah that goes there	
3	24		
3	24		###
3	24	No, the other way	
3	24	Turn it the other way	
3	24	Yeah, there it go	
3	24		
3	24	There ya go. Now let's look for the rest of the bird	
3	24	I think this goes	
3	24	I think this goes	
3	24		Let's put it right there
3	24		
3	24	There we go	
3	24	Mm-mm. Turn it around. Try the tail, try it the other way.	
3	24		###
3	24	Nope	
3	24		
3	24	Try turning it around, like this	
3	24	No, that doesn't go either. Let's try this piece.	
3	24		
3	24	There ya go	
3	24		That's the part
3	24	See try to match the colors	
3	24	Naw, that doesn't go

3	24	In the corner	
3	24		
3	24	Oh yeah	
3	24		I'm gonna get a treasure box
3	24	Then this goes	
3	24		
3	24	That goes there	
3	24		###
3	24	I think that goes with the fish some kind of way	
3	24	Mm-mm	
3	24	Try that one right here	
3	24	No, like this	
3	24		
3	24	There ya go	
3	24	Oh and this goes down here I think. Try right, try right there. No turn it around this way so that that piece	
3	24	Does it go?	
3	24	Naw, it doesn't go	
3	24	Oh, try it up here	
3	24	Turn it around, turn it around	
3	24		
3	24	There you go	
3	24	Now	
3	24	Think that goes down here	
3	24		
3	24	Where do you think this one goes?	
3	24		mmm
3	24	mmm, not quite	
3	24	Look at the colors, match the colors.	
3	24	mmm	
3	24	Nope	
3	24	Good job	
3	24		
3	24		
3	24	Match the colors; look at the colors	
3	24	How about down there?	
3	24	mmm	
3	24	Does that go?	
3	24	I don't think that goes right there	
3	24	No, let's move it over	
3	24		It do go right there
3	24	No, it goes with the octopus	
3	24	You gotta move 'em around	
3	24	See?	
3	24		
3	24	Now	
3	24	There it's- that's better	
3	24		
3	24	Nope, turn it the other way	
3	24	Nope, the other way	
3	24	Yeah. That goes in there	
3	24	That one	
3	24	The eye	
3	24		
3	24		What's that?
3	24	It goes here	
3	24	Oh, no	
3	24		Goes with the octopus
3	24	Yeah, yeah, this way	
3	24	Think, yeah, that way.	
3	24		
3	24	Keep turning until you get it to fit	
3	24	There ya go	
3	24		
3	24	Nope	
3	24		
3	24	There, good job	
3	24	And the last piece	
3	24		
3	24		
3	24	Okie dokie, we're done	
3	24	I'll tell her	
3	24		Okay, I'm gonna bring it
3	24		
3	48		
3	48		I'm doing the ants
3	48	This one is a lot more pieces.	
3	48		Uh oh, 55 pieces?
3	48	No, 48	
3	48		
3	48		48 pieces
3	48	*singing*	
3	48		Mommy, look. Na-na-na-na-na
3	48	You have to take it apart.	
3	48		No no no no no no no no no no no
3	48	*singing*	
3	48		No no no no no
3	48	*singing*	
3	48		Where'd that, where'd the bird one go?
3	48	I don't know	
3	48		*humming*
3	48	*singing/humming*	
3	48		Oh
3	48	*singing*	
3	48	*humming*	
3	48	Uh-oh	
3	48		
3	48	*humming*	
3	48	*humming*	
3	48	*humming*	
3	48	You're cheating	
3	48	You can't take it apart off of here and then put it together over there	
3	48	So that's what you're gonna do?	
3	48	That's how you're gonna do it, huh?	
3	48		I'm gonna cheat
3	48	Okay	
3	48		
3	48		I'm cheating
3	48	That's not good	
3	48		How I'm cheating?
3	48	Because you're just taking it apart, and then sticking it back together. You're not mixing up the pieces	
3	48		I don't wanna mix up the pieces anyway
3	48	If you mix up the pieces it makes it more fun	
3	48	'Cause it makes it more challenging	
3	48		
3	48		Nope, not fair
3	48		
3	48	Yeah, fair	
3	48		no fair
3	48	*singing*	
3	48		no fair
3	48		Okay where do you think this goes? Where do you think the butterfly goes?
3	48	The butterfly's over this way I know	
3	48	May as well finish off the bird	
3	48		
3	48		Guess we'll finish off the bird
3	48	mmkay	
3	48	So, these, this goes down here somewhere	
3	48		Okay
3	48	You want some pieces over there by you?	
3	48		This goes
3	48		right here I think
3	48		This goes right here I think
3	48	No. You have to have something with a flat bottom .	
3	48		Yeah, it goes right
3	48	To go down there. So maybe we'll try it on top?	
3	48		Okay
3	48	There	
3	48	But this doesn't go	
3	48		Oh this goes right
3	48	Naw, I don't know if that goes with that at all	
3	48		
3	48		Trust me, ###
3	48	I don't think so	
3	48	And I don't know where this goes	
3	48	Okay, let's just, let's just try putting some parts together	
3	48		
3	48		### When I get my surprise?
3	48	Well, you have to complete the study first	
3	48	*singing*	
3	48		Nope, don't go
3	48	*singing*	
3	48	*singing*	
3	48		I need another red
3	48		Where's some red?
3	48	*singing/humming*	
3	48	Let's see... Let's put this piece in here	
3	48	No, it doesn't go	
3	48	Does this go? Yeah that goes 	
3	48		But
3	48	Let's move it over to this side maybe	
3	48	Like that	
3	48		
3	48	Yeah	
3	48	mmkay	
3	48		What's on this ###
3	48	And I think the butterfly goes down here in the corner	
3	48		
3	48		*singing*
3	48		*singing*
3	48		
3	48	No, I don't think that goes; here try this one	
3	48		*singing*
3	48	Stick the, stick it in there	
3	48	No, that point, in there, try it in there	
3	48		*humming*
3	48	No, that doesn't go. Let's try another one	
3	48		
3	48		*humming*
3	48	Let's try this one	
3	48	Stick it in there	
3	48	There we go	
3	48	I think	
3	48		Think yeah
3	48	Yeah, there we go	
3	48		
3	48		This go right here
3	48		
3	48	Ooh, good job	
3	48		
3	48	The- I think these stay over this way	
3	48	Like	
3	48	I'm trying to think	
3	48	Does it go, no I think it's got some red, goes over there	
3	48	Like this one, try this one in there	
3	48	In here	
3	48	Yeah	
3	48	And then that goes	
3	48	right here	
3	48		
3	48	good job	
3	48	You think that goes there?	
3	48	I think we need to look for something with leopard spots	
3	48	Let's	
3	48	Let's try to find something with leopard spots	
3	48	No	
3	48	It has to have a flat side though	
3	48	This puzzle is more challenging	
3	48		
3	48	Good job	
3	48	Maybe it goes here?	
3	48	Maybe	
3	48	Maybe	
3	48	No	
3	48		No?
3	48		But it have green right here
3	48	Yeah, but it's a little different; let's try this one	
3	48		It's already sticked
3	48	I got it	
3	48	mm-mm	
3	48		mm-hmm
3	48	Let's try that one. No, turn it around	
3	48	Like this	
3	48	No, I don't think that, that doesn't go either	
3	48	Oh, wow	
3	48	How about this one?	
3	48	Did we try that one already?	
3	48	No	
3	48		I think we goes right
3	48	Where's the ant's head?	
3	48		I don't have no ant head
3	48		*sigh*
3	48	Okay, this goes here	
3	48		
3	48	Let's try to finish the rest of the butterfly, then maybe we can	
3	48		
3	48		
3	48	No, this goes with the bird	
3	48	So that's the beak	
3	48	Now let's see where it goes with the bird	
3	48	It goes, I think maybe somewhere	
3	48	Mm-mm. That doesn't look right	
3	48	I know this goes down here	
3	48		
3	48		### Seconds
3	48	How about this? Try this one here	
3	48		
3	48	Mmkay	
3	48		I want my four seconds
3	48	I don't think that goes there	
3	48		Nope. Try the other one
3	48	This goes here	
3	48		Yup
3	48		Goes right here
3	48		
3	48	Now	
3	48		Ooh I think this goes right here

3	48		No
3	48		###
3	48	Mm-mm don't bang it	
3	48		*whining*
3	48	No, that doesn't fit; you can't force it to fit	
3	48	That doesn't go there	
3	48	Let's look for something with a leaf	
3	48	Are we missing a piece?	
3	48	Did a piece fall off ###	
3	48		Hmm
3	48	No	
3	48		
3	48		
3	48		Where's this go?
3	48	I don't know	
3	48	I think it goes over here. Maybe	
3	48	No	
3	48	Oh, up here. Try it up here	
3	48		It's move ###
3	48	Nope, this way	
3	48		
3	48	There we go	
3	48		Okay
3	48	Now let's look for-	
3	48		
3	48		*whining*
3	48		
3	48	Don't get frustrated, it's okay	
3	48	Let's try, let's try this piece down there	
3	48	Try that piece	
3	48		
3	48	There ya go	
3	48		*whining*
3	48	Now, the froggy-	
3	48	How about we try this piece right there	
3	48	Does it go? No it doesn't fit	
3	48		No
3	48	Let's try another piece	
3	48	Aah, let's try this piece	
3	48	Try this piece right here	
3	48		
3	48	Aha!	
3	48		*laughing*
3	48	And, think we're gonna finish this one in time	
3	48		
3	48		So I can get my surprise
3	48		
3	48	Ah, there you go	
3	48		
3	48	Let's see	
3	48	Yeah, try that one up there	
3	48	No, you had it the right way the first way though, press it in	
3	48		
3	48	Good	
3	48		*laughing*
3	48	Now	
3	48	This goes over here somewhere	
3	48	Try it here, but I don't think it goes there	
3	48	Ooh, we have it wrong, we have to move this down	
3	48		
3	48	Now	
3	48	Nope, this way	
3	48	Yep	
3	48		
3	48	There you go	
3	48	This one next	
3	48	Right there

3	48	See how when you look for the colors	
3	48	Now what about the froggy?	
3	48	mmm...

35	48		Where- Where do- Where do will they go?
35	48	Let's figure that out, that's what we do with puzzles	
35	48		Where does this one go?
35	48	Let's see. Let's turn 'em all upside-up first	
35	48	How 'bout this one, so we can see what we're looking at	
35	48		Where does it go?
35	48	I don't know. I'll do this one	
35	48		Where?
35	48	Where? Let's look. This one	
35	48	And this one	
35	48	And this one	
35	48		Which one?
35	48	This	
35	48		Where does it go?
35	48		Where does it go?
35	48	Let's find out	
35	48		Where?
35	48	Okay	
35	48		Where?
35	48	Now, You know what I like to do? Is I like to start with the ones that have straight ends, like this	
35	48		Which one?
35	48		Can you help me do this one?
35	48	I s- I can help you. This has a straight end, and this one has a straight end	
35	48		Where does this one go?
35	48	This one looks like it goes in a corner	
35	48	And that looks like it goes in a corner	
35	48		Where does this one go?
35	48	Mmm, let's figure that out	
35	48	And this one has straight, this one has straight	
35	48		Where does this- this one go?
35	48	Look. This one has straight, does it look kinda like that one?	
35	48	Do you think maybe they go together?	
35	48		What about this one too?
35	48	Yeah. That- You're right. That probably goes close to this one	
35	48		This one. That one
35	48	So let's try putting this one- 'Kay this one goes in the-	
35	48		And the- And the- That one goes to this one... And where should we put this one?
35	48		
35	48	Try putting that one in that corner	
35	48	Can you turn it?	
35	48		Yeah
35	48	Turn it a little more	
35	48	Good, keep turning	
35	48	And then fit it in the corner, good	
35	48		
35	48	And where was the other- This one we thought went close by	
35	48	Does that go nearby?	
35	48		Yeah!
35	48	*gasp* *laughing* Well done. Does that one go close by?	
35	48		###
35	48		Uhh
35	48		
35	48		Yes
35	48		It does!
35	48		It does
35	48	Yo, good job! You know what? This one doesn't look like it quite matches. Let's, take that out for now and try another one. Maybe... which one, has these colors? Do you see a piece?	
35	48	That has those colors?	
35	48		Which one?
35	48		With the- Where does this one go?
35	48	That looks like it goes in another corner. Maybe in this corner? Or that corner?	
35	48	Or maybe this corner	
35	48		Right here
35	48	You think it goes there?	
35	48		We can move a little right there
35	48	'Kay	
35	48	Where do you think that goes?	
35	48		Where's it- Where d- Where does it go?
35	48	Where do you think it goes?	
35	48		### Where does it go?
35	48		Where does it-
35	48	Do you think it looks like it c- might go around there?	
35	48		Right here
35	48	*gasp*	
35	48		
35	48		Uhh, I gotta fit it in there
35	48		
35	48	Good job!	
35	48	What about that one?	
35	48		I did it
35	48	You did? It's close	
35	48	But I think it might go better up there	
35	48	Try turning it	
35	48		I did it
35	48	*laughing* It's good but the colors don't quite go. Let's try turning it one more time, that way	
35	48		Where does- It goes right here
35	48		
35	48	Good, that looks nice! Oh, what about that one?	
35	48		Where- Where's the other one?
35	48		Where does it go?
35	48		Where does this one go?
35	48	See here it's got a little bit of blue, like the blue over here	
35	48		
35	48	Good	
35	48	Now look, this- This has some blue too	
35	48		Where does it go?

35	48		
35	48	Good! And now this, I see has a little bit more blue	
35	48		Where does this one go?
35	48	Can you show me how it goes?	
35	48	Put the blue close to the blue	
35	48	###	
35	48		Where is it?
35	48	Let's see, where's the bl- Where's the blue over here?	
35	48	Good. Try turning it?	
35	48	Turn a little more, so the blue is close to the blue	
35	48	Yeah, oh	
35	48	Keep turning it 'til it works	
35	48		Does it go like this?
35	48	How 'bout like that?	
35	48		Now where's the other thing?
35	48		Where the other one that-
35	48	Think maybe it goes there	
35	48		
35	48	Good	
35	48		Where's the other one?
35	48	Okay, now look. D- what does this look like?	
35	48	What's that look like?	
35	48		A lion
35	48	You're right. Does it look like part of his eye?	
35	48		A tiger
35	48	A tiger? Do you see anything else that has an eye?	
35	48		###
35	48	Yeah, see if that fits	
35	48		Where- Where does this one go?
35	48	I don't know, we gotta figure it out, huh?	
35	48	Is there another piece that has an eye?	
35	48	Do you see any of these pieces that have an eye?	
35	48		This one
35	48	Good job! Try that one, see if it fits	
35	48	Keep turning it	
35	48		Where does it go?
35	48	Keep turning it- Oh! *gasp*	
35	48		
35	48	Good job! good job you got that	
35	48		Now where does this one go?
35	48	Let's see here. Oh, and this is a little piece of- oh yeah, yeah try it! I think you had it!	
35	48		I did it
35	48	*laughing* you did. It fits but I don't think it quite goes- That's his- part of his nose and there's his eye and there's part of his eye	
35	48	Try	
35	48		
35	48	*gasp* good job. Now do you see any pieces here that look like they might be part of that nose?	
35	48	Good!

35	48		
35	48	Having a hard time going in?	
35	48		I did it
35	48	Good! Look at that	
35	48	Now is there anything else that's got dots like that? That might be part of-	
35	48	The leopard? Good! Yep, that	
35	48		Where does this one go?
35	48	Let's see	
35	48	###	
35	48		Where does it go?
35	48	Did it go there?	
35	48	That looked good to me	
35	48	Did it fit?	
35	48		Which where?
35	48		What? Where?
35	48	Did you put it right there?	
35	48	Try turning it	
35	48	That doesn't fit quite right	
35	48		
35	48	Yeah, good job!	
35	48	I think I see another one with some dots	
35	48	Try turning it	
35	48	Keep turning it	
35	48	Maybe it goes on this side	
35	48	Yeah	
35	48		
35	48	Good job	
35	48	Good job. Now, let's see here	
35	48	I think that- What do you think that is?	
35	48		Where does it- this one go?
35	48	That looks like- Oh that's close. This looks like part of his...	
35	48		mmm
35	48		This, here?
35	48	Good	
35	48		A ear
35	48		
35	48	Ear	
35	48	Do you see any other piece that looks like it might be his other ear?	
35	48	Any piece?	
35	48	That looks like an ear?	
35	48		I don't see one
35	48		This one
35	48	*laughing*	
35	48		Where- ###
35	48		Goes right here

35	48		
35	48		*noises*
35	48		Right there!
35	48	Now do you know what these are?	
35	48	These are called mushrooms. Let's see if we can find another piece that has some mushrooms	
35	48		Is it- What about that one?
35	48	That has pretty flowers. Do you see anything with mushrooms?	
35	48	Ooh- ### the pieces	
35	48	Do any of these have mushrooms?	
35	48		No
35	48		I don't see some
35	48	Good	
35	48		
35	48	Good!	
35	48	You got it	
35	48	Now I think that this, might go up in that corner	
35	48		Where
35	48		Up here?
35	48		
35	48	Yeah. Now do you see any other pink flowers?	
35	48	Good!	
35	48	Good job!	
35	48		Would it be good right here?
35	48	And remember to keep trying to turn it, until it fits	
35	48	Nice	
35	48		
35	48	Good job	
35	48	and then... I see a little bit of pink flower right there	
35	48		Where does this one go?

35	48		Where does this one go?
35	48	Keep turning it. I bet you'll see it	
35	48	Good	
35	48	I think you're close	
35	48	I think you're gonna get it	
35	48		
35	48	See? I knew you'd get it	
35	48		
35	48		*laughing*
35	48	Alright, where's some more orange ##

36	48	See if you can put those together	
36	48		###
36	48	Let's see	
36	48	Now, this doesn't go like this, but see- See if...	
36	48	No	
36	48	Here. See w- If this one goes on here like that	
36	48	No, twist it	
36	48		Twist
36	48	Here, can you come over here?	
36	48		*noises*
36	48	Come on	
36	48	NAME, NAME. Okay, that's enough	
36	48		We're gonna break my rocket
36	48	It's not a rocket	
36	48		*laughing* yes it is
36	48	Come here	
36	48		It goes like *noises*
36	48	Come here. Come over here	
36	48		*noises* ###
36	48	Mmkay. Let's see if we can put the ants on	
36	48	Can you put the ants on?	
36	48	Hope we didn't drop any pieces on the floor, did we? Okay, see if we can remember where the ants go	
36	48	Mmm... Think it's like this	
36	48		That's not his tongue. That's the nose
36	48	Yeah, that's this nose	
36	48		Sorry I was wrong
36	48	Yeah, you were, but that's okay	
36	48		
36	48	Umm, let's see- Oh. Look. So let's try to do these pieces. Let's figure out where these pieces go	
36	48		Hmm?
36	48	Okay	
36	48		Wrong and right right! Go go ###! Go go ### *noises* ### Go go ###!
36	48	Maybe they go over here	
36	48	Here, see if you can go- put this over here	
36	48	See if you can put this on here	
36	48		Hmm
36	48	This one	
36	48	See if you can put that on there	
36	48		Mmm
36	48	Listen to me, does that go on there like that? Push it	
36	48		No
36	48	Push it. Yes it does, good job. See? I wasn't even looking at that. Wanna see if that goes on there?	
36	48		
36	48		Uh-oh!
36	48	We're all done with this	
36	48	All done	
36	48		*whining* I must finish ###
36	48		###
36	48	come back, NAME	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
37	48	You want this one or this one?	
37	48		Um, this one
37	48	This one, okay. So, part of this study-	
37	48		
37	48		I have- I might have to get ### Y- Yeah
37	48	Scoot you a little closer. Is to s- Is to w- um, watch	
37	48	Watch us do a puzzle together, so let's look at the picture	
37	48		
37	48	And then	
37	48	We'll do the puzzle	
37	48	'Kay? You ready?	
37	48		Oh
37	48		Yeah
37	48	Okay	
37	48	I see a great big snake	
37	48	###	
37	48		I want a ### too
37	48	You can have one after we're done	
37	48		Mmm
37	48		*humming*
37	48	Umm	
37	48	Okay, should we turn over all the pieces?	
37	48	And then Whi- Where do you wanna get started?	
37	48	Which animal or-	
37	48	Creature. The butterfly, okay	
37	48		Butterfly
37	48	Okay, well let's see, alright	
37	48		
37	48	I think this looks like it goes on an edge somewhere	
37	48		Bu-
37	48		*whining*
37	48	Let's see, should we line it up against an edge?	
37	48	Oh, in fact, you found a corner piece	
37	48	Great!	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	You wanna put it here in the corner?	
37	48	### Maybe it- Maybe it goes like that	
37	48		
37	48		###
37	48	Okay	
37	48	Let's see here	
37	48		*noises* After a while can we go in the other room next to this, to the other room behind this wall, and we'll hide and seek in there. I'll hide behind the curtains
37	48	After we do two puzzles. Then we can go next door	
37	48	Yes. Yes. Mm-hmm	
37	48	Umm, we'll see	
37	48		We have a few minutes?
37	48	We probably have a few- few minutes. Let's do the puzzle	
37	48		Okay
37	48	Okay	
37	48	So, let's work on the butterfly first. What work goes next?	
37	48	Alright that's a good idea. Let's get all the butterfly pieces and then we'll see how they fit together. So like, the blue, blue butterfly pieces, I'm looking for pieces with the blue wings	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Ooh I think I found a piece	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	That looks like a very good piece. You see how there's some purple, and there's some purple here	
37	48		Pur-Purple
37	48	Maybe they go together	
37	48		Um, How?
37	48	Well, what if we turn it like that. See if it fits in there	
37	48		*noises
37	48		
37	48	Okay, great. Now, um, I see a few other pieces with blue, let's-	
37	48		I think I wanna get in
37	48		
37	48	Your seat?	
37	48		Yeah
37	48	Alright, I'm gonna, Okay, I'll scoot my chair back, and you scoot yours up	
37	48	Alright	
37	48		Mmm
37	48	Okay, well	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Umm, let's work on the pieces with the green and the blue first. 'Cause this looks like it connects to maybe, like is- this looks like part of a cheetah's nose or something. This might come next	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Well actually no, you're right, look. Hello! You did it! Good, I didn't realize we were ready for that piece already. You were right	
37	48		
37	48	Mmm... Try again. Try a different spot	
37	48	Good guess	
37	48		### *singing* ###
37	48		
37	48	Good. Okay	
37	48		Who that door- Where that door-
37	48	There's lots of other people in this building. Let's- Let's finish this um, butterfly piece. Where do you think this piece might go?	
37	48		Right here, right th-
37	48	Do you see how it has a flat edge?	
37	48		Oh
37	48	Probably goes along the side	
37	48		
37	48	That's it	
37	48	And, uh, what about this piece?	
37	48		Ooh
37	48	Is there another flat edge?	
37	48		Ooh
37	48	Good guess	
37	48		Ooh
37	48	Where else are we missing part of the butterfly?	
37	48		
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Hmm?	
37	48		Um
37	48		###
37	48	Okay	
37	48		Ta-da!
37	48	Ta-da	
37	48	Alright, that's a different part	
37	48	Uhh, where's the piece you were working on? This piece?	
37	48		*noises* I can ###
37	48	*laughing*	
37	48	Okay	
37	48	How 'bout this piece?	
37	48		###
37	48	Let's- Let's spin around on the chairs after we're all finished, okay?	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Okay, here's the piece. I think it might go along this flat edge	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Okay, NAME. Do you wanna have time to play with the other toys?	
37	48		Yeah
37	48	Great. Let's keep working then	
37	48		But first I wanna play hide and seek in the other room!
37	48	We'll see if we have time	
37	48	Okay, where does it go?	
37	48		Ooh
37	48		
37	48	That's it. Great. Okay, I think there's just-	
37	48	You see this piece here?	
37	48	If we- Oh, I think I see it	
37	48	Do you see a piece with some bright blue on it?	
37	48		Where?
37	48	Look around	
37	48	That's it	
37	48		*noises*
37	48		
37	48	Great, now what animal are we working on?	
37	48	What is it- What animal has spots?	
37	48		Cheetah
37	48	Cheetah? Could be. Okay let's find the cheetah pieces	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	### and let's find all the pieces with spots	
37	48		Why does she have a camera like that?
37	48	Because they're taping, um, you and me, and they want to see how we do a puzzle together	
37	48		Why do they have that camera?
37	48	That's just the kind they have	
37	48		Oh
37	48	Mm-hmm	
37	48	Okay, these look like cheetah pieces	
37	48	Okay. Ooh, I think I see part of the nose. Do you see his little red- orangeish nose?	
37	48		
37	48	Good	
37	48		Now ###
37	48	Oh, we're- Is the frog next? Looks like this might be a snake's head, but-	
37	48		I think it might go *noises* I guess we're not ready for that piece
37	48	Yeah	
37	48	Um, do you see some eyes?	
37	48		Where?
37	48	This looks like part of his green eye, and I see another piece with some other eyes	
37	48	That's it	
37	48		*noises* *whining* I can't do it
37	48	### Look, look, look at this piece right here. Look at this piece right here. And look a this, maybe they connect	
37	48	Turn it the other way	
37	48	Keep turning	
37	48	That's it	
37	48		
37	48	Wow, and, so we need another big green eye, part of the cheetah. And I think I see just the piece	
37	48	See how this is part of his eye?	
37	48	Where's the other part of his eye?	
37	48		Mmm
37	48	I think it's on the board here	
37	48	Yes	
37	48		
37	48	Good! It's coming along	
37	48	Where do you think that could go?	
37	48		
37	48	Try a different spot	
37	48	Do you see another kind of... cut-out hole, where some- yes.	
37	48		
37	48	Very good	
37	48		Now can we play hide-and-seek?
37	48	Well, we have to finish this puzzle and one more	
37	48		And then go?
37	48	*laughing* Yeah	
37	48	Let's see. Umm, see how this has- it's kinda yellow with black spots?	
37	48	Where on the puzzle do you see some yellow and black spots that needs finishing?	
37	48	That's it. That's it	
37	48		
37	48	Ooh and I think I see part of a snake's head up above. That's kind of exciting	
37	48	Let's see, is there more of the snake?	
37	48	Ooh, this looks like part of a snake	
37	48		Ta-da!
37	48	*laughing* What's that?	
37	48		###
37	48	Uh-huh, it's a little too close for me to see it like that	
37	48	I'm not sure where that piece goes. W- Here's how, um, I think we can finish the puzzle. If we go animal by animal. So right now, we're working on-	
37	48	We're finishing up this cheetah, and also we can work on the big snake up here. That's part of his head	
37	48		But I see teeth
37	48	I do too	
37	48		Maybe it's, um, a dra- Maybe it's a crocodile
37	48	Let's keep building the puzzle and then we'll see for sure	
37	48	Um, I think this looks like part of the snake. And also this	
37	48	You wanna see if there's a way it can go to build the snake more?	
37	48	Maybe not there. Try a different spot	
37	48		I want you to do it
37	48	Well you're doing it. They wanna see how you do it. How we do it together	
37	48		How
37	48	That's it. That's it	
37	48		
37	48	You just did it	
37	48	Super	
37	48	Okay	
37	48		Um
37	48	Alright	
37	48	We're making good progress. Do you see this piece? And how it has a flat piece on top?	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	This might go at the very top	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Might have to kneel up a little bit	
37	48		
37	48	That's it	
37	48	Great. Now, this gives us a place to start building the top, too!	
37	48		###
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Okay, Um, Let's see, Where-	
37	48		*noises* ###
37	48	We need more of the snake, and we need more of this cheetah	
37	48		### one
37	48		*noises* *singing* butterfly, butterfly, butter- butter- butterfly, butterfly
37	48	There's nothing under here	
37	48	Let's see. This looks like part of a cheetah. See how p- it's part of a spot?	
37	48		
37	48	Mm-hmm	
37	48		What's he do? What's *name* doing?
37	48	I think he's just playing with some toys in there. Okay look at this big green leaf here	
37	48	This looks like part of that leaf and this looks like part of a leaf	
37	48	Try a different way	
37	48		*noises* Oh
37	48	Yep. Probably that got torn. Okay, let's try to turn it a little bit	
37	48	That's it	
37	48	Good	
37	48	That's it, right there. You found the right place	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Well at least I thought you did	
37	48	You know what? Mommy is wrong. It looks like it goes there, doesn't it? But it actually doesn't. So let's try this piece. Let's see if this piece fits	
37	48		*noises*
37	48		
37	48		
37	48	That fits	
37	48	Okay, so this must go somewhere else	
37	48	Umm	
37	48	Hmm, okay. This looks like- What animal do you think these belong to?	
37	48	Any ideas?	
37	48	Maybe a little tree frog. Okay, what- What is this animal that likes to eat leaves?	
37	48	Hmm?	
37	48	What could that be?	
37	48		A crab
37	48	Crab?	
37	48	Well, it's kind of reddish like some of our pictures of crabs, but I think it's an ant. Let's get all the ant pieces together and see if we can do the ant	
37	48		Cra-
37	48		*noises*
37	48		
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Well, could this be part of the ant? Maybe that's part of his mouth	
37	48		
37	48	Mmm, okay. And look at these pieces, I think they're the legs	
37	48	Where could that piece go?	
37	48	That's it	
37	48		
37	48	Good	
37	48	How bout this piece?	
37	48		
37	48	Good	
37	48	Alright, any more ant pieces? We're making great progress	
37	48	Umm	
37	48	Okay	
37	48	Let's see	
37	48	###	
37	48		Think there's only two
37	48	Well something must go here, something kind of reddish. Oh- This one	
37	48		
37	48	Okay, now we're on the red, umm	
37	48		
37	48	The red plant. That's it. Where could this go?	
37	48		
37	48		
37	48	Making great progress. Okay. Now, we're gonna- We could go up here, or let's ### look for this big green-	
37	48		### what's this ###
37	48	Looks like some bird is eating a cherry or something. Look at this leaf. You see how there's green leaf both of these places? Maybe this piece goes around here	
37	48		
37	48	Mm-hmm	
37	48	Okay, and, what if this is part of a frog?	
37	48	Do you see part of a- a frog anywhere?	
37	48	Yes	
37	48		
37	48	Good	
37	48	Coming along	
37	48	Let's see, so we need part of a green leaf here, and maybe there's another frog nearby	
37	48	Or maybe not. Let's see. Umm	
37	48	Ooh I think I see a piece with a tiny bit of red. Maybe this can connect here	
37	48		
37	48	Okay, so now...	
37	48	Do you see- look at this orange	
37	48	Do you see some oh, the- You see this orange color here?	
37	48	### these go in this	
37	48	Think you need a piece with a flat edge. Is there anything with a f- yeah	
37	48		
37	48	Mm-hmm. And now maybe this can connect	
37	48	That's it	
37	48		
37	48	Ooh, nice. Okay	
37	48	Umm	
37	48	Let's see, any more of that orange or yellow? Oh, here's some yellow	
37	48	Like this maybe	
37	48		
37	48	Good	
37	48	And I see some more yellow here	
37	48		Okay soon we're gonna have to stand up
37	48	Or we can slide the piece c- the puzzle closer to us	
37	48		Ooh
37	48	Okay, umm, how 'bout this piece? See how there's some yellow?	
37	48		
37	48	That will be a nice piece, umm	
37	48	Looks like-	
37	48	Oh I do see some green. Look, I think you might have just found the spot	
37	48		
37	48	Good	
37	48	Okay let's- Let's work on these kinds of colors. See how it's yellow and greenish? Maybe these colors	
37	48		
37	48	That's it	
37	48	How 'bout this piece, what could this ###?	
37	48		
37	48	That is it	
37	48	Great	
37	48	Here	
37	48	Look at this. Where- where do you think this piece could go?	
37	48	Very good	
37	48		
37	48	Mm-hmm	
37	48	Okay, coming along! I see some um, pink flower. Maybe we could find some pink flowers	
37	48		Ta-da!
37	48	### Ta-da! Okay, and what goes next?	
37	48		
37	48		Ta-da!
37	48	Great	
37	48		
37	48	We are almost finished	
37	48	This to me looks like part of that snake	
37	48	See the snake's on this side? Ooh, good	
37	48		
37	48	And now we're got some red leaves	
37	48	See some red over here?	
37	48	Let's work on that	
37	48	Here's some red, yep. I think we're- we're on here now	
37	48		
37	48	That's it	
37	48		There's two
37	48	You- Right, there are two frogs. Okay, um	
37	48	Well, these three pieces probably go around here somewhere	
37	48		
37	48	Great	
37	48	Where else could it go?	
37	48	That's it	
37	48		
37	48		
37	48	Mm-hmm	
37	48	Getting close, you need a flat edge up there	
37	48		
37	48	Mm-hmm	
37	48		Where does this go?
37	48	Do you see these colors in here? Like with this stripe of brown, and here's some brown stripe. Maybe, goes around in here somewhere	
37	48	Try turning it different ways	
37	48	Does that fit?	
37	48	No, what about in here?	
37	48		
37	48	Good. Except, yeah. Yeah there's the tip of the grass, okay	
37	48		
37	48	Mm-hmm	
37	48		
37	48		
37	48		
37	48		
37	48	Great job	
37	48		Now can we go in the other room?
37	48	We have to do one more puzzle, and then we can go in the other room and play. Okay?	
37	48		Oh. Is this the first one?
37	48	Yep. This is the bigger one. Then we get to do a- I think a sh- a piece- a puzzle with fewer pieces	
37	48		*noises*
37	48	Okay, I'll go find *name*, see if we can do the other puzzle	
37	48		I will!
37	48		
37	48	*laughing* you can help me	
37	48	They want us to stay in here with the c- with the um, camera	
37	48	Oh, you're gonna love this one, NAME. I think I know where- where you're gonna want to start	
37	48		
37	24		
37	24	Ooh, what do you see?	
37	24	Hmm?	
37	24		I would love to start with that
37	24	Sounds good. Let's break it all a- I know	
37	24		Shark! I love sharks!
37	24		*noises* Oh mom! It's a shark!
37	24	A great white man-eating shark	
37	24		*noises*
37	24		*noises*
37	24	Okay, help me out here. Let's turn all the pieces over	
37	24	No no, over so we can see the picture	
37	24	I did most of 'em so I was saving some for you. Okay. Let's get this one and this one	
37	24		Maybe I'll start over here
37	24	No, we need you to stand, stay over here so the camera can watch you. Okay? The camera wants to see how, um, 4 year old boys do puzzles	
37	24		
37	24		And why is it bigger?
37	24	It's up high so it can see you	
37	24	It can have a good view	
37	24	Of you and the puzzle	
37	24	Let's do the shark	
37	24	Okay, do you wanna find all the shark pieces?	
37	24	Maybe put them together? Or you can start with a different animal	
37	24		When I start- Um, when can I have, a toy?
37	24	What's that?	
37	24		Um, When can I have-
37	24		Um
37	24		When can I have, a, ###
37	24	A what?	
37	24		Um, l- What- Um I was talking about something with, um
37	24		I'm talking about something like, um
37	24		Like a, new thing. Like, um, what was that o- those other sw- swimming creatures?
37	24	What swimming creatures?	
37	24		Um, something
37	24	In a book?	
37	24		Um like, I ### something with, um, Something with um, a, um, a, what's those other creature called like a shark and a whale, and a tuna. And I found something with a hard skin
37	24	Like a, like a shell like a crab?	
37	24		No, something else
37	24	Umm, oh, like a, um, it's spiky?	
37	24		
37	24		Yeah
37	24	That, uh, mr. hermit crab, uh, an urchin?	
37	24		No, like, um, something else
37	24	Like umm	
37	24		Something
37	24	Like a clam	
37	24		Um, no, no, um, um, a fishes tail
37	24	A fish that has a hard shell?	
37	24		Yeah. A big one, like a s- shark
37	24	Hmm	
37	24	I- I'm not sure. Let's do the puzzle and maybe we'll think of it. Maybe we'll see something in the puzzle that will remind us	
37	24	Okay, let's find all the gray pieces of the shark. What do you say?	
37	24	Did you see that the shark was gray?	
37	24	'Scuse me	
37	24		Oh
37	24	Let's get all the gray pieces and see how they fit together	
37	24	Okay?	
37	24	You see some teeth?	
37	24		Oh, ###
37	24		*noises*
37	24	*noises* Let's start there. I see, Okay. Ooh, don't bite me, shark	
37	24		*noises*
37	24		*noises*
37	24	Alright	
37	24		Gobble you up
37	24	*noises* Okay	
37	24	Where can it- What- wh- what can this connect to?	
37	24		*noises*
37	24	Mmm, good. Okay, I think that's exactly how it went. Okay. How bout an- like a dorsal fin	
37	24		Mmm
37	24	Mm-hmm	
37	24	What else do we need?	
37	24		###
37	24	Maybe a tail	
37	24	What do you think- Where do you think this gray piece could go?	
37	24	Good, and now I think it fits right up in this corner	
37	24		
37	24	Super. Okay, what's next?	
37	24	What- What animal was this orange one, do you remember?	
37	24		
37	24		
37	24	Mm-hmm. What animal is it?	
37	24		Octopus
37	24	Yeah	
37	24		Mmm. I can't do it
37	24	Look at that flat edge, straight edge. Where does that straight edge go?	
37	24		
37	24	Yep	
37	24	Okay	
37	24		How do crabs poop?
37	24	Umm	
37	24		### the lobsters poop
37	24	They have special uh, holes, a special opening where the poop comes out	
37	24		Where?
37	24	Well, we'd have to look at one up close	
37	24	Maybe we could go to the aquarium and ask somebody	
37	24		Okay
37	24		
37	24	That's it	
37	24	Okay	
37	24		Is it squirting ink?
37	24	Ooh, maybe if it's frightened it could. Think it's frightened by this big shark?	
37	24		Yeah
37	24	Yeah maybe it's about to squirt some ink	
37	24		I wish I was at the aq- aquarium to see a octopus squirt ink
37	24	I would love to see that too. I've never actually seen one squirt ink before	
37	24		###
37	24		And what would you say if it did?
37	24		
37	24	If it squirted ink on me?	
37	24		What?
37	24	Mmm, I think I'd say, "I've gotta get this ink off of me. I have to get- get a washdown"	
37	24		No! A glass wall around the octopus
37	24	Oh, then you're right it couldn't squirt me. I thought you said it- like if I was swimming, doing deep-sea diving	
37	24	But you're right	
37	24	I had a- There's a glass wall. He couldn't squirt me	
37	24		Um, then where's more of it?
37	24	More of what?	
37	24		This
37	24	Well I think you- Well let's see, We are missing- There- There's a few-	
37	24	### This looks like it's something	
37	24	Purple and purple	
37	24	You see that straight edge?	
37	24	That means something	
37	24	It means it goes along an edge	
37	24	Maybe you're not ready for that piece yet	
37	24		###
37	24	Maybe this piece has to go first	
37	24		
37	24	Mm-hmm	
37	24		
37	24	Good	
37	24	What do you think this creature is?	
37	24		I don't know
37	24	Well, what color is it?	
37	24		Orange
37	24	Mm-hmm. Let's find some more orange pieces to see if they connect	
37	24		What's this blue?
37	24	Umm... I th-	
37	24	Actually, is this part of this gray?	
37	24		
37	24	Might be part of a swordfish	
37	24		Yeah
37	24	Mmkay	
37	24		*noises*
37	24	We're getting there. Here's some blue. You wanna work on the swordfish?	
37	24	Blue?	
37	24		I don't want to
37	24	We're almost finished. Let's finish up, then we'll be all done	
37	24		###
37	24		*noises*
37	24		
37	24	Nice	
37	24	Where do you think this piece could go?	
37	24		
37	24	Yeah	
37	24	Coming along!	
37	24		Maybe it's afraid of the shark
37	24	Maybe. It has a nice big pointy sword thing in front	
37	24		Maybe it- Maybe it could poke an octopus
37	24	Maybe it could	
37	24		Yeah
37	24	Uh-huh, Okay so I think you- Do you wanna work on this orange? Or do you wanna work on the blue? What- What's next?	
37	24		
37	24		### shark ### to try to
37	24		eat it
37	24	Mm-hmm	
37	24		Maybe um, it would poke at it
37	24	May- Exactly. It could be like a protective, um, device	
37	24		Yeah
37	24	Okay, I see some purples missing with this, little um, is that a sea anemone?	
37	24	And maybe this little purple could be part of it	
37	24		
37	24	Oh, it's coming along! Okay	
37	24	What could go here?	
37	24		Now i wanna sit on your la-
37	24	Alright	
37	24		Now what?
37	24	Well, you tell me. We're getting there	
37	24	What- What could go here?	
37	24	That's it	
37	24		
37	24	Nice	
37	24	Okay, any other orange pieces?	
37	24		Uh
37	24		
37	24	Mm-hmm	
37	24	Your puzzle's more than half-way done!	
37	24	Well y- I do see pink there, but since this has a flat edge, it probably has to go over here	
37	24	Probably right around there. Why don't you find another piece with pink that could maybe go in the middle	
37	24	That looks like a corner piece	
37	24		
37	24	So there's probably something that goes in between and connects these two	
37	24		Maybe this
37	24	Well this doesn't have a flat edge. Why don't you see if it could connect with the pink over here	
37	24	Ooh, that looks- That looks good because see the blue?	
37	24		
37	24	Mm-hmm. And then maybe this goes down here like that	
37	24	We'll see	
37	24		But
37	24	Or maybe it goes up here	
37	24	Maybe it's the top. That's it	
37	24		
37	24	Great	
37	24		What does this go to?
37	24	Well, is that the head of a seahorse?	
37	24		
37	24	Mm-hmm	
37	24		
37	24		
37	24	Nice	
37	24		Maybe um
37	24		I'm working on a whale
37	24	Yes	
37	24	Do you see this little bit of pink?	
37	24		
37	24	That's it	
37	24		
37	24		
37	24	Great! We did it!	
37	24		Now can we go play hide and seek?
37	24	Let's see if we can play it a little bit in the other room	
37	24		Okay
37	24		
37	24		Mommy!
37	24	NAME, You gotta do two more games with Miss *name* and then-	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
38	48		
38	48	Alright, that help you feel better?	
38	48		Mm-hmm
38	48	Okay, good	
38	48	Mmm	
38	48	And let's make sure we get our fingers clean, 'cause we're playing with someone else's puzzle, right?	
38	48	Mmkay	
38	48		And they don't want us to be mad at us
38	48	*laughing* Right, well we certainly don't want to make a mess	
38	48		Yeah and we don't wanna get juice on this puzzle
38	48	That's right	
38	48	Okay, all set ###?	
38	48		And that's the same shirt that I have up there
38	48	It sure is!	
38	48		Well, it's too big
38	48	*laughing* You think those are too big?	
38	48	Okay, are you ready? How do you- Oh, let's put this in the trash. You ready?	
38	48		Yes Mommy, Yes Mommy, Yes Mommy
38	48	Alright	
38	48	*kiss*	
38	48	Okay	
38	48		Let's go
38	48		
38	48	Let's go!	
38	48		First we gotta take the puzzle-
38	48	Okay	
38	48		Break them *laughing* Then we gotta mix them up
38	48	Okay	
38	48	Alrighty	
38	48		But ### we take the pieces out
38	48	Mm-hmm	
38	48	Alright, ###	
38	48		A lot of pieces, because they're so little and tiny
38	48	Mm-hmm	
38	48	Mm-hmm	
38	48	###	
38	48		Now let's get ### now let's mix them up
38	48	Okay, I think they're- Oh, here, I think they're mixed up enough, okay. Ooh	
38	48		Uh-oh. I dropped me some pieces. Uh-oh I dropped me some pieces
38	48	Okay	
38	48		There
38	48	Alright	
38	48	###	
38	48		Alrighty. What is that, Mommy?
38	48		
38	48	Those are the mints. I don't think you like those	
38	48	You want one?	
38	48	Okay	
38	48	Aah, that's my finger! *laughing* Alright, how are you gonna get started?	
38	48		Why do you get two?
38	48	Because I'm a big person. Let's go	
38	48	So, where should we start?	
38	48	Let's see	
38	48		Up here!
38	48	Up here?	
38	48	So how do we know what goes up there? Ooh, I just remember it's a jungle and a bunch of animals	
38	48	Well, I don't know, this probably goes at the top, but I don't think it goes over there. Right, 'cause it has a flat top?	
38	48	So what else has a flat top?	
38	48		Uhh, this!
38	48	Okay, let's see	
38	48	Alright, some more flat- any more flat tops?	
38	48	Oh, I have some more. What about that one? Where might that one go?	
38	48	### has a- Yeah, so that one would go in the corner. Nice	
38	48	Hmm. You- You have some, well we got a lot of flat pieces	
38	48		This one
38	48	### this one, I don't know	
38	48	Let's see. Is that a flat top?	
38	48	I'm not sure if this one goes at the top or the bottom	
38	48	Hmm	
38	48	And this one too	
38	48	Oh well, Hmm, this one looks like a flower?	
38	48		I think these go together
38	48	Hmm	
38	48	Well, it was a good idea. Not quite, but that's a good idea. Should we find some more of those?	
38	48	Do we have any more of those with the red?	
38	48	Let's put 'em all together so we can see 'em	
38	48	And this one- Yeah, this one red too	
38	48		Red
38	48		
38	48		Here's some red too
38	48	Hmm	
38	48	Oh, this one-	
38	48	Mmm	
38	48	Did you try this already?	
38	48	Nope	
38	48	Oh this- Oh yeah it doesn't. This has these little pointy pieces. Does one of those fit over there?	
38	48	Mmm, try it the other way	
38	48	Nope	
38	48	Nope, see that doesn't match	
38	48	You got one side left	
38	48		This one ###
38	48	No, this one	
38	48		Yep
38	48	Now we just gotta figure out which corner it goes in, we're not really su- Wait, ###	
38	48		This one
38	48	You think that one? Okay, we'll start there	
38	48	How 'bout, aah, is some more red pieces, or, here's some more	
38	48		it's ###
38	48	Well this looks like the same kind of plant	
38	48		We can't do this puzzle
38	48	Well, do you wanna s- try putting something else together, maybe the leopard?	
38	48	Mmkay	
38	48	Let's put that little froggy to the side, and put this on the side	
38	48		*noises*
38	48	Whoa, is that the leopard?	
38	48		Yes
38	48	No, that's a- Oh, that's his nose *laughing* Huh, okay. Is this his nose too?	
38	48		Mm-hmm
38	48	Maybe, his freckles	
38	48	on his nose, Oh good. What else?	
38	48		This is his body
38	48	### That's his body?	
38	48	Mmm, nope. Don't force it	
38	48	That doesn't belong. Put his nose back together. What's above-	
38	48		Oh it's upside-down!
38	48	Is it? Uh, no I think turn it the other way	
38	48	Remember their nose is different ###	
38	48		
38	48	Alright how about-	
38	48	What's above his nose?	
38	48		###
38	48	What's above your nose?	
38	48		A forehead
38	48	*laughing* A forehead? And what's below your forehead?	
38	48	What's between your nose and your forehead?	
38	48	Look at me. What's between my nose and my forehead?	
38	48		Eye
38	48	Eyes. He has green eyes. *laughing* Does that go there? Or maybe, I don't know, here's another one	
38	48		*laughing* *noises*
38	48	That one doesn't fit. Does this one?	
38	48		###
38	48	There's an eye	
38	48	Oop-	
38	48		The eyes go down here
38	48	No, this is his nose, this is- The eyes go above his nose	
38	48	Nope	
38	48	Hmm, oh here's some- Here, just find all the pieces. Here's some more eyes	
38	48	Mmkay, and then where's the rest of his eye?	
38	48	Pay attention	
38	48	Okay good, now what else has the spots?	
38	48	Mmkay, let's see if we can figure it out that one	
38	48	Good job. Alright, so we're making so progress here. Umm... What about this blue area?	
38	48	### Okay	
38	48		This piece
38	48	Let's see. Nope. There's some more blue pieces over here	
38	48	There's other blue	
38	48		This goes on the side
38	48	Hmm. Yeah that's gonna go on one of the sides. You're very correct about that. Can you- Oh here's some green and some blue	
38	48		
38	48		
38	48	Hey it fits. Alright, here's some more	
38	48	Another- It goes on one of the sides. This one or this one or this one	
38	48	Oh, that's-	
38	48		### this one
38	48	Oh but, well not this one, see this is- You see these? These are mushrooms so they're growing up from the ground	
38	48	So we'll save that one. Try a different one	
38	48		Mm-hmm
38	48	Okay, ### try that one	
38	48		
38	48	Good	
38	48	Now, you see you have blue on both sides, the top- The side and the bottom	
38	48	Mm-hmm. Well, that looks close but this is a s- a straight piece, so they lets- that knows- ### you should know it goes on the bottom	
38	48		
38	48	Okay	
38	48	Now, any more butterfly pieces?	
38	48	Don't fall out the chair	
38	48		This one
38	48	Okay	
38	48		
38	48	Good, now this is his body	
38	48		Well, is his body- This?
38	48	###	
38	48		It's his body
38	48		
38	48	### that's his body, good. Okay so now, let's see. Just-	
38	48		Oh I think I see some more butterfly pieces
38	48	Well, the butterfly pieces that I see are on with the leopard, or the cheetah, I think it's a leopard	
38	48	So, see how these blue pieces might connect all together	
38	48	You don't see? You want me to do it?	
38	48		Mm-mm. I ### it
38	48		
38	48	No?	
38	48	Okay, so pu- leave this in the corner, and then we're just gonna pick this up	
38	48	There you go. And put it in there	
38	48	So, we'll just have to wait. Get those pieces in there first	
38	48		
38	48		
38	48		
38	48	'Kay you're gonna want to put those together, before you-	
38	48		
38	48		
38	48	Alright, excellent	
38	48		Now we're almost finished
38	48	Yeah, we got maybe half-way. So, let's see	
38	48	We got this little dude up there	
38	48		Ooh I found- I see this dude
38	48	It's another f- tree frog?	
38	48	This go down here, let me just do it	
38	48		
38	48		There's some mushrooms right here
38	48	Are those mushrooms?	
38	48		Mm-hmm
38	48	No, I think that's the color of the frog's body	
38	48	Does this go here? No. That does not	
38	48		Yes it do
38	48	No. This- no. This one?	
38	48	Aw, NAME	
38	48	Buddy buddy	
38	48	Uhh. Look, did you see what I did over here? I put these together	
38	48	This is another bird, Oh here. put this- rest of the cheetah	
38	48	This is another part to the cheetah. What part?	
38	48	There's spots	
38	48	Or a jaguar. Who lives in the jungle?	
38	48		The king
38	48	*laughing* The king?	
38	48	What kind of animals-	
38	48	do	
38	48		Lion
38	48	Lions? What does *name* talk about, living in the jungle?	
38	48	Baby...	
38	48		Jaguar
38	48	Jaguar. That might be a jaguar. Here's a-	
38	48	Here's a piece, does that go together?	
38	48	Oh here's some mushrooms	
38	48		
38	48		### that goes on ###
38	48	That goes on the ground	
38	48		
38	48		Oh here's some mushrooms
38	48	Oh, yep. Good job	
38	48		
38	48	Oh now this looks like a log. Is that a piece of wood? Piece of log ###	
38	48		
38	48	Yay, we got the bottom. Alright so these flowers, *laughing* Yeah, are put together. Now...	
38	48		We- Yeah
38	48		I chewed my vitamin
38	48	Your peppermint?	
38	48		Yes
38	48	Alright, now. Let's think about what walks on the ground. Ants. I see some ants. Mm-hmm	
38	48		Ants
38	48		### on the ground
38	48	But that's a piece of mushroom. See that?	
38	48		It goes on the ground
38	48	On the ground, next to the mushroom	
38	48		
38	48	The ants go marching	
38	48	Okay, so more ants, here's some ants	
38	48		The ants go
38	48		*singing* Marching. The ants go marching, the ants go marching down, on the ground, ### of the rain boom boom
38	48	*singing* rain boom boom boom	
38	48	Oh here's a little piece	
38	48	Oh, close, not quite. You wanna try that one? Mm-hmm	
38	48		Here's another piece
38	48		
38	48	There we go. Now try the other ant	
38	48		
38	48	Alright, making progress	
38	48		Now I see... I see some more ants
38	48	Do you see any more ants? Mmm, I don't know	
38	48		I think this-
38	48	Oh	
38	48		goes- we're almost finished!
38	48	Man. Okay, Let's see. I see- Come over here. I see...	
38	48		Ooh I see-
38	48		Uh
38	48	Oh, that's a good idea. Not quite. Look at this. You see this? It's a little tree frog's- You- you know what a tree frog's little fingers look like?	
38	48	Hmm, turn it. Or it- Or it could be this one, this has tree frog fingers too	
38	48		
38	48	Now look at the leaves	
38	48	See the bright green?	
38	48	Can you match up the bright green	
38	48		
38	48	Hey, is that a fit? Yay!	
38	48	Any more tree frog fingers?	
38	48		Ooh, ### here
38	48	Right there? Match up the green	
38	48		
38	48	Mmm right, any more tree frogs?	
38	48	Tree frogs	
38	48	What about that big guy right there?	
38	48	Hmm	
38	48	So we got his feet but we don't have his body. Is this his body?	
38	48		
38	48		Yay, what about this little guy?
38	48	I think you had him in the right- In the correct corner	
38	48		
38	48	Mmkay. So let's see what we have, we still have this piece	
38	48	Where could that go?	
38	48	Mmm, oh there you go

38	48	But, it's a straight edge so, there you go. Nice	
38	48		
38	48		Now, I found something
38	48	Mmm, this is sort of orange	
38	48		Not quite
38	48	Not quite? I don't know what's going on up here either. Alright, let's it's gotta be-

38	48	The leaf	
38	48	Oh, it doesn't fit, does it? Yes what about this little bit of orange?	
38	48		This one

38	24	So let's get it togeth- Let's get 'em together	
38	24		*noises* 
38	24	*laughing* What are you doing?

38	24		Ugh! Ugh! Mommy you gotta scoot me up some more
38	24	###	
38	24	That's as close as you can get, dude. The chair is humongous	
38	24	Purple

38	24		This belongs here, right?
38	24	I don't think so	
38	24		Yes it do, see?

38	24		Nemo, Nemo, Oh, I hope we could watch Nemo
38	24	Boy, put this together	
38	24	Do you see this straight edge at the bottom? That's the starfish, in the bottom corner	
38	24		*noises* and let's just pick it up
38	24		
38	24	Well, it would have been easier to pick up the starfish	
38	24		
38	24		
38	24		
38	24	Good. Now let's get the other eye to the octopus, and the rest of his body	
38	24		
38	24		Like that?
38	24	Mm-hmm	
38	24		And let's get the other eye
38	24	We got two eyes	
38	24	Get the rest of his body	
38	24		###
38	24	### that's a different orange. That's the crab orange	
38	24		
38	24	It's a little more red	
38	24		
38	24	Alright good	
38	24		Now we gotta find the octopus arms
38	24	Well, I think you've pretty much got his arms	
38	24		Those are his legs
38	24	*laughing* Oh, I see, those are his legs so these are his arms. How many?	
38	24		One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight
38	24	We got 'em all. Alright, let's move to the next animal	
38	24		The crab!
38	24	The crab? Okay. I think this is the crab down here	
38	24	So put the rest of him together	
38	24	Look at the sand, right? The sand is at the bottom. Is that the bottom over here?	
38	24	No, it's not	
38	24		
38	24	There we go	
38	24		I do like the- Ooh! Here's some more sand

38	24	Mm-hmm	
38	24	Not quite	
38	24		
38	24	There we go	
38	24		What about the other eye?
38	24	Mm-hmm	
38	24		
38	24	Alright	
38	24		Why do he have this- like these eyes?
38	24	### his eyes actually move like this *noises*	
38	24		Why?
38	24	*laughing* Alright, keep going. Shark. Or, I forgot what was over here	
38	24		This one
38	24	Okay	
38	24	Oh, the swordfish?	
38	24		Yeah, the swordfish
38	24		Do this have a... corner piece?
38	24		Nah
38	24	Nah, it's not a corner piece	
38	24		It goes in here
38	24	You're right, it's up there somewhere	
38	24	But what- How 'bout this blue? Maybe if we get the blue then we can get the uh-	
38	24	No, this dark blue	
38	24	The whale	
38	24	Oh no, this is the swordfish. This is his body	
38	24		Yeah that's the swordfish
38	24	But that goes at the top 'cause it's flat	
38	24		
38	24	What is this? Is that somebody's body?	
38	24		
38	24	Hey, that worked out	
38	24		What is this one?
38	24	It's his-	
38	24		###
38	24		The swordfish?
38	24	That's the sword, right?	
38	24		Yeah
38	24	Mm-hmm	
38	24		
38	24	Mm-hmm	
38	24		This is this tail. So it goes back here
38	24	That's a different animal's tail though. His tail is down here	
38	24	Look at the color	
38	24		Oh
38	24		
38	24	Is that a corner piece?	
38	24		
38	24		Going in there
38	24	Mm-hmm	
38	24		
38	24	Okay	
38	24	Excellent progress	
38	24		Now I wanna do this
38	24	Okay	
38	24		
38	24	Good thinking	
38	24		Is this the jellyfish?
38	24		
38	24	It is the jellyfish	
38	24		Jellyfish stings
38	24	They sting, yes	
38	24		Yeah
38	24		How do they sting, though?
38	24	Sting? Well this- They have these things, these things called tentacles	
38	24	mmm	
38	24		
38	24		That helps them sting?
38	24	That's what they sting ###	
38	24		People?
38	24	Well, fish, and people if people get in the way	
38	24		
38	24		Well why do jellyfish don't say 'scuse me?
38	24		
38	24	*laughing* Why don't they say excuse me?	
38	24		Yes
38	24	*laughing* That's a great question. Umm...	
38	24	I guess they figured people better watch out for them	
38	24		
38	24		But jellyfishes are way far away like the sharks
38	24	Yeah, they're out in the ocean. Yes	
38	24	Is that a corner? Think	
38	24		
38	24		Can we go ho- Oh, We are finished. Now let's go call- Now let's go-
38	24		
38	24		
38	24	You going to get *name*?

39	24		Mommy, this is Ne- This is Nemo ###
39	24	What	
39	24	But, but hold on, you have to- It is Nemo, but let's turn it over	
39	24		
39	24		Mmm
39	24	And mix 'em up so we can- We don't wanna cheat	
39	24		### This goes together
39	24	It goes together? You're cheating	
39	24		Mm-hmm
39	24	You're cheating. Okay turn 'em over. Turn 'em over over over over over over over over over. Okay, let's mix 'em up	
39	24		*laughing*
39	24	###	
39	24	Okay. let's turn 'em back over to the front. Front. Turn 'em to the front	
39	24		*laughing*
39	24	Front	
39	24	Front front front front front front front front front front and front	
39	24		*laughing*
39	24	Alright, now	
39	24		We can do- Ow
39	24	Oh I am sorry, ###	
39	24	Okay now we have to see which one goes where	
39	24		
39	24	So we know that this is a corner, here	
39	24		I know
39	24		
39	24	One fell on the floor over there	
39	24		Oh yeah. That's the octopus. Ah- ah- can't ###
39	24	You got him?	
39	24		Ah- Oh, Ooh
39	24	Oh my goodness	
39	24		Oh my goodness
39	24	### knock down all the pieces	
39	24	Okay	
39	24	Okay now we know ### also another corner	
39	24		Ooh, let me do the octopus!
39	24	But it's not a corner though. Yeah ### Yeah ### goes up against the side	
39	24		And
39	24	This is a corner	
39	24	I don't know which one it goes on but that's a corner	
39	24	Let's find another, this is a corner	
39	24		Ooh! This goes right here I think. It goes right-
39	24	But there's another piece that goes right there. 'Cause this the gray part of the shark's tail, so look for another piece that has a gray part of the shark's tail. I think it's this one. Let's see. There you go	
39	24	Oh, now what goes right there?	
39	24	I think this goes up here like that	
39	24		
39	24		No-
39	24	And who goes here?	
39	24	That's not a end piece though	
39	24	'Cause the end piece ### have the little straight back	
39	24	Yeah, that goes somewhere, we have to figure it out	
39	24		It goes right there-
39	24	Mm-mm. Let's see. That's right	
39	24	But okay	
39	24		Wait! I think this goes right there... no
39	24	Try it another way

39	24	And let's see, this goes here	
39	24		
39	24		No
39	24	Well let's just keep this here, because we know that we're close	
39	24	Let's try this here	
39	24		
39	24	Okay	
39	24		You're messing up my puzzle pieces
39	24	Well scoot it over some, and just leave it right there. Because you know that's correct. Okay now let's find some other surrounding pieces that go in	
39	24	I think this goes here	
39	24		And I think this-
39	24		
39	24	scuse me I passed gas	
39	24		That's okay
39	24	Mmm. Mmm. Try a different way	
39	24	Yes

39	24		
39	24	### this ###	
39	24		
39	24		### the octopus

39	24	Mmm	
39	24	Very good senorita	
39	24		
39	24	Great job	
39	24	Now that's not a end piece, it doesn't have a straight-	
39	24	Mm-mm. It goes it the corner because see, it's a straight here and a straight there. That's a end pie- It's a corner piece	
39	24	Let me see, oh wait, ### I don't know. It goes over there somewhere. Oh there it is. It goes there	
39	24	Let's try another piece	
39	24	See if you could figure out where the rest of the- one of the other ones go	
39	24	Oh my word	
39	24		What?
39	24	What is going on, child?	
39	24		I don't know. I passed gas excuse me
39	24	Thank you for saying excuse me

39	24	###	
39	24	Oh, no?	
39	24	Oh, sorry	
39	24	Okay, let's try another one	
39	24	### here's a bottom piece	
39	24	This goes here

39	24		
39	24		Oh
39	24	Does that go there?	
39	24	Well look all over, look somewhere else, ### that back up. Pick that one back up. No pick that one back up. That you just had	
39	24	And look- Look all over 'cause it does go here	
39	24	Nope, it doesn't go there. But look s- Look somewhere- Look somewhere else it could go. It has a- the- look at the back. When you have a- When you have a side like this, that means it's flat, then it goes somewhere around the edge of the board	
39	24		Wait I think this goes right here
39	24		
39	24	Woah, good job	
39	24	Mmm yeah yeah yeah yeah	
39	24

39	48		*laughing* Ooh this goes right there
39	48		Hey I'm not cheating
39	48		*laughing* I'm breaking up the puzzle pieces
39	48	### and remember, look. If it has a flat side, it goes up against here, somewhere. Okay?	
39	48	You don't care	
39	48		*noises* Let's mix them all together
39	48	And look. Look look look look look NAME, it has two flat sides, Look. It has two flat sides. That means it goes in a corner somewhere

39	48	See? Right. Mm-hmm	
39	48	We don't know which corner yet, but we know that's a corner piece. Tha- Yeah, Mm-hmm, that's a corner piece	
39	48	But it has to go like- It has to go up against, like that	
39	48	Oh, cool. Cool	
39	48		This is fun
39	48	Cool, dude

39	48	Mm-hmm	
39	48	What about this one? No, that goes- No no no that doesn't go there. There's a end piece, there's another piece that goes right there, try that one	
39	48	See where that goes	
39	48	That's a end piece, not a middle	
39	48	That's a end piece

4	48	You're gonna do that part? I'm gonna put the edge pieces in	
4	48		Wait, wait, I'm gonna take these pieces
4	48	Then it'll be easier	
4	48		And I'm gonna put them right there

4	48	See, then it go that way, yeah	
4	48	*gasp*

4	48	*gasp* Oh, I think it all fits together, just like that	
4	48		
4	48		It's coming apart
4	48		*noises*
4	48	You did it! *gasp* And then look	
4	48	### can figure out that one

4	48		Hmm
4	48		This one here
4	48		
4	48		Yeah, it goes right there
4	48		Does this one go like
4	48	Oh, ### Do you think this goes up here somewhere?	
4	48		
4	48		
4	48		And the part is, that one goes up there, his head
4	48	Good!

4	48	No	
4	48	You're just being silly	
4	48		*noises*
4	48	*laughing*	
4	48	Where do we think that goes?	
4	48	Let's see, what was growing on the bottom, Mushrooms, look	
4	48	Maybe that goes there?	
4	48		
4	48		Yes
4	48		Mushrooms
4	48	Mmm, Let's look for another edge	
4	48		Hey I think mushrooms, I think mushrooms are growing in their garden
4	48	Think they're growing in the garden?	
4	48		It's
4	48		Yeah, it's starting, I think that's turning to a jungle
4	48		
4	48		
4	48		I don't want my house in there in the jungle
4	48		
4	48		Aah!
4	48	*laughing*

4	48	Woo hoo	
4	48	Mmkay	
4	48		My house is turning into a jungle, that's crazy!

4	48	*gasp*	
4	48		Let- Let me
4	48	Okay	
4	48		I got the one
4	48	Here, look. This one looks like it goes somewhere around that too	
4	48		###
4	48	And this one	
4	48		###
4	48	I don't know what these are, some kinda other kind of plant	
4	48		
4	48	Oh my gosh you're so smart! This must go all the way over there, then	
4	48	You think?	
4	48	I wonder if you turn this around	
4	48	Over there, and put it on that	
4	48	That it would fit over there	
4	48	Might have to pick it up	
4	48	Turn it the other way	
4	48	Yeah	
4	48	*gasp*	
4	48		
4	48	See?	
4	48		Hey! This one's, this part is not fitting
4	48		
4	48	Oh Oh yeah it is	
4	48	There ya go	
4	48		And this
4	48	It looks like this piece is part of that, too	
4	48		Part of that? Oh
4	48	Somehow	
4	48		
4	48		Yeah it does goes there
4	48	Cool	
4	48	###	
4	48		###
4	48	Mmm	
4	48		This poor guy
4	48		This poor guy-y
4	48		Aye aye, captain
4	48	Mmm	
4	48	I think there's some ants over here, too	
4	48		
4	48	What do you think	
4	48	Think this goes like here	
4	48		With what, like, this fits right there
4	48	Coo- Oh my gosh you are so smart	
4	48		Like this
4	48	Uh, oh that looks like it goes by the mushrooms. Look, it looks like it has a little bit of mushroom on it so it probably needs to slide down in here somewhere	
4	48		Well these are not fitting with the ###
4	48	Maybe not	
4	48		It looks like it's part of this
4	48	Oh, it doesn't go there because look, it's not an edge piece	
4	48	Maybe it doesn't go all the way down there, maybe there's another mushroom somewhere	
4	48	Oh look, wait, try to put that one right here. Try to put the ant right here	
4	48	No, the other one The one that's in your hand	
4	48	Yeah	
4	48		
4	48	Yeah, there you go	
4	48	And then put 'em back like you had 'em	
4	48	No like you had 'em before when these three all connected	
4	48	Not on the bottom, up on this one	
4	48	I think this one goes first	
4	48	See, 'cause that's the back of the ant	
4	48	Connect it to the ant	
4	48	Look, up in here	
4	48	No, not that one	
4	48	Look where the pictures match up	
4	48		
4	48	Yeah, there you go	
4	48		Okay just like this
4	48	And then that one goes behind it	
4	48	No, remember how you had it before?	
4	48	There ya go	
4	48		
4	48	There	
4	48	Okay which of the edge pieces go underneath here do you think?	
4	48	Will one of the- look! I see some ant legs on there	
4	48	mmm	
4	48		This one go like that?
4	48	um	
4	48	That looks like it hits part of the mushroom	
4	48		What the-
4	48	Here	
4	48		That's weird that that, that, th-
4	48	I don't know what that was. I heard that before, too	
4	48		
4	48	Look, what do you think about this one. Does it look like ant legs?	
4	48		Yeah, it looks like ant legs
4	48		
4	48		It goes right there
4	48	Good! Look, we're almost done	
4	48	We have so much of it done already	
4	48		This could fit here
4	48		it fit ## somewhere else
4	48	Hmm	
4	48		
4	48	I wonder where those go	
4	48	Can you figure it out?	
4	48		Yeah
4	48	Oh this looks like part of the snake	
4	48		Snake
4	48	Up there	
4	48	Um, I think, look 'cause it's on the edge.  See where that's a flat edge?	
4	48	I think it goes up here somewhere	
4	48		Oh!
4	48	*gasp*	
4	48		It fits right here, but it, it's not going because I have to move it
4	48	You don't have to move it, you just have to pop it in there like a click	
4	48		
4	48	There	
4	48		*laughing*
4	48	*laughing*	
4	48		Pop it
4	48	Just pop it right in there	
4	48	Oh	
4	48	It looks like that might go next to it	
4	48		*noises*
4	48	No, over by the snake	
4	48		
4	48		Oh, it's not fitting, ooh
4	48		
4	48	Get it in	
4	48		
4	48	*gasp*	
4	48		###
4	48		Oh
4	48		This puzzle right here, this puzzle round
4	48		This, how I turn this ###
4	48	I think maybe it goes by the snake	
4	48		I go by the snake
4	48	*gasp*	
4	48		
4	48	You did it!	
4	48		It goes like that, monkeys go like that
4	48		
4	48	Woo hoo!	
4	48		I did it
4	48	mmhmm	
4	48		I helped you
4	48	You helped me, you're right	
4	48		And this piece might go somewhere else
4	48	You know what, lookit. See how it has flat edge, it means it goes up here somewhere	
4	48		Oh yeah
4	48		You're right, Mom!
4	48	*gasps*	
4	48	Oh you almost had it. You gotta put the flat edge in the top	
4	48	Turn it around	
4	48	Yeah, there you go	
4	48	Tur- No, look, look	
4	48	See?	
4	48	The flat edge goes by the flat edge	
4	48	And then I think those fit together	
4	48		
4	48	*gasp*	
4	48	Woohoo	
4	48		And where does this piece go?
4	48	mmm	
4	48	That does not have a flat edge, so it doesn't go up there. But this one goes right here	
4	48		
4	48	And then I think this is the last edge piece	
4	48		
4	48	Can you get it in there? Woo!	
4	48		Uh
4	48		And where does this flat edge go?
4	48	Only a couple more pieces	
4	48	Look	
4	48		It goes to this!
4	48		
4	48	*gasp*	
4	48	I got that one	
4	48	Parrot	
4	48	Uhh, Try it- Scoot it over that way	
4	48	Oh, you know what?	
4	48	Oh, maybe it goes down here somewhere	
4	48	Like maybe this one. Oh look, yeah, them leaves match up right there	
4	48		
4	48	Those are kinda hard to push in there, right?	
4	48		
4	48		There's a piece missing right here
4	48	Mm-hmm, What do we think that one is?	
4	48	Try this one?	
4	48	Hurry	
4	48	Almost done, almost done!	
4	48		
4	48	Yep. Oh look, I think that one slides right into there	
4	48	Wait, it was right	
4	48	Put it right, right there	
4	48	Pop it in. See where it matches up?	
4	48		
4	48	Look, one more piece!	
4	48		###
4	48	Mmm, Might have to turn it around	
4	48		
4	48		
4	48	*gasp* Woo hoo, ###	
4	48		Let's go do some puzzles with *name*
4	48		Like this ###
4	48	Um, we're gonna do one more together. Let's go tell her that we're done with this one	
4	48		Yeah
4	48	Here, can you reach?	
4	48		Hey
4	48	What?	
4	48		I wanna know what that big thing is
4	48	### I think that's for the computer	
4	48	Say "we're done"	
4	48		
4	24		
4	24		Ooh
4	24	Alright	
4	24		Yeah
4	24		Now break it apart!
4	24		
4	24	### it apart	
4	24		Rah!
4	24		Stupid butts!
4	24	No	
4	24	Don't say that	
4	24		I'm building an ###
4	24		See these ones will go down there
4	24		###
4	24	Oh, was that already put together?	
4	24		Yeah
4	24	You're a cheater	
4	24		I I I ###
4	24	Wha-	
4	24		I I I, Can you push me in?
4	24	Mm-hmm	
4	24		Slide me in *noises*
4	24		How do we know this puzzle is a shark
4	24		This puzzle's kind of noisy
4	24	Yeah	
4	24		How about this one goes, like, here
4	24	*gasp*	
4	24		
4	24		Got it
4	24	Do you think maybe we should turn it around though? 'Cause it looks like he's upside down	
4	24	Well no, not the whole thing, just the- Here, like maybe it goes this way	
4	24	I think	
4	24	Here's another piece of the octopus	
4	24	And, is that another piece? *gasp*	
4	24		A sucker. It's a sucky
4	24		It's called a sucker winner
4	24	Should we watch Elf when we get home?	
4	24		No
4	24	No?	
4	24		Why
4	24		Why should we watch Elf?
4	24	I don't know, because it's so funny and you keep talking about it, it makes me want to watch it	
4	24		*noises*
4	24		
4	24	Did you figure that one out?	
4	24	I think- *gasp*	
4	24		
4	24	Good job	
4	24	Here's another part of it. I think these two both go with it, too	
4	24		It's a big butt
4	24	What does he say when he goes in the-	
4	24	In the mailroom, right? He says "It's a sucky thing"	
4	24	When the mail thing sucks up the mail	
4	24	Is that what you were trying to talk about?	
4	24		Yeah
4	24		He sucks up, sucks up the ###
4	24	It's so sucky, right?	
4	24		So sucky
4	24		This thing is so sucky
4	24		Sucky
4	24	Here, I think that goes underneath it	
4	24		*noises*
4	24	Look, I have a crab almost done	
4	24		Crab
4	24	Oh yeah I think if you turn it around you might fit that one in there	
4	24		Yeah
4	24	*gasp*	
4	24	Ooh, you're so smart	
4	24		What ###
4	24	I think it might've- I think it might go right next to this	
4	24		
4	24		Yeah
4	24	You think?	
4	24	Oh, slide it in there	
4	24		
4	24	Whoa	
4	24		*noises*
4	24	That is so cool	
4	24		Look at what we did
4	24	Look, I think this is the jellyfish or something	
4	24		
4	24		Jellyfish. Ooh and
4	24	Oh, look	
4	24	You have to get the mouth of the shark right next to where you just had it	
4	24		
4	24	Right there, yep	
4	24		
4	24	Hmm	
4	24		Jelly
4	24		Jellyfish
4	24	*gasp*	
4	24	###	
4	24		*noises*
4	24	And this goes somewhere in there, too	
4	24		This is a big man
4	24	I forget what that's called	
4	24		Think that goes right there
4	24	*gasp*	
4	24	Woo hoo!	
4	24		And where does this piece go?
4	24	I dunno, mmm, maybe, maybe down here somewhere	
4	24	And I think this one goes right up-	
4	24	Uh	
4	24		No!
4	24	Oh, maybe it goes right there!	
4	24		
4	24		No, it's gonna make two sharks if we went right here
4	24	*gasp* Look, I think this all slides back together	
4	24	Slide it on over	
4	24		
4	24		
4	24	*gasp*	
4	24	Oh my gosh	
4	24	We are so smart	
4	24		Yes, we are
4	24		
4	24		This goes right here
4	24	Good job	
4	24	I think	
4	24	This might be that corner over there	
4	24		
4	24		That's where I want it to fit in
4	24	Mmkay where do you think that one goes?	
4	24		*noises*
4	24		This, I don't know how this goes
4	24	Oh I think you had it right, look at where the edge is	
4	24	Look at where the edge is	
4	24	See where the straight parts are, and where the straight part of the puzzle is?	
4	24	That thing is going on again, what is that?	
4	24	*laughing* What is it-It's part of that over there	
4	24	I think it's part of the heat or something	
4	24	Air's coming out of that, that's why it's making that noise	
4	24		It's going like
4	24		*noises*
4	24	*laughing*	
4	24	Mmm, I don't think that's right. 'Cause this doesn't fit. You're gonna break the puzzle	
4	24		
4	24	Try where the top of the puzzle is	
4	24	Look, look at how this has, Lookit, Look at this piece, it has two straight lines on it. Right by your hand, this straight line and this straight line, It means that it is in a corner	
4	24	So it either goes in this corner or this corner. Which one do you think it goes in?	
4	24		This corner
4	24	mmm	
4	24	Ya think?	
4	24	I don't	
4	24		Jellyfish? I think that goes with here
4	24	Mm-hmm	
4	24		
4	24	Alright	
4	24	Well we gotta push the whole puzzle over, that's why	
4	24		Ooh
4	24	Yep, then that goes up there!	
4	24		
4	24		Pop!
4	24	Woo hoo!	
4	24	Alright, what do you think, we got a couple more pieces	
4	24		Pop it in
4	24		Ooh this is one big one!
4	24		I can't believe this is one big one ###
4	24		This is one one big one
4	24		Big one
4	24		This one probably goes right here that one goes there
4	24		
4	24	Well what do you think- I think that one goes up there somewhere 'cause it matches	
4	24		It matches?
4	24	Maybe just try to keep turning it	
4	24	Mmm	
4	24	I don't know if that matches, try the other way	
4	24	Keep- Keep it going	
4	24		Oh It, it matches this way
4	24	Oh, there

41	48		
41	48	Come on this is gonna be a little bit-	
41	48		
41	48		A little bit harder
41	48	Just- Yeah, 'cause this is that 48 pieces, instead of-	
41	48		Yeah
41	48		Instead of the other one
41	48	Right	
41	48		This one going to be a little bit harder, 'cause, it look small
41	48		Gonna be a little bit harder
41	48		Mama, this go right here, right? Mama, this-
41	48	Well, Right, Yeah, But- Yep, that's right	
41	48		Mama, this go right here
41	48		This go right here?
41	48	It goes somewhere at the top, it goes on the edge I believe	
41	48		So it gotta be right here?
41	48	Maybe. We got another piece missing on the corner though	
41	48	Is that it? Nope	
41	48		Nope
41	48	Let's see, this was ###	
41	48		It's supposed to be with the butterfly
41	48		*noises*
41	48	This goes somewhere on the bottom	
41	48		Yeah
41	48	## goes there. This piece goes here. Well-	
41	48		### This go right here
41	48		
41	48	Let's see, why don't you try these pieces- The- The butterfly, see and this, you can match these-	
41	48		Yeah
41	48		Mmm
41	48	Why don't you ### Look at these pieces. Why don't you match these pieces?	
41	48		Huh?
41	48		Those pieces
41	48	Those	
41	48	Mm-hmm	
41	48	And then I'll work on the bottom	
41	48		That one- But these are hard
41	48	No, but look. Here you got a cheetah	
41	48	Look	
41	48	There his eye. No but look where his eye is. Let's turn it around ### green, remember? The colors have to match up. No, look at the green in his eye. See?	
41	48		Oh
41	48		Ah
41	48	That's where that goes. Now look at this, that's his other eye	
41	48		Mama, why he have one eye?
41	48	We're gonna see when we put it all together	
41	48	This is his other eye right here	
41	48		Mama w-
41	48	We'll put that piece there. That's somebody else's eye. Look at the butterfly, see? Here's a butterfly ###	
41	48		I don't like butterflies
41	48	I thought you loved butterflies	
41	48		But butterflies have they eyes up
41	48	They have their eyes up?	
41	48		Yeah, they got big butterflies
41	48	Okay, look

41	48	That's gonna be a beautiful butterfly	
41	48	Really pretty colors	
41	48		Yeah
41	48		I- I do like butterflies, but sometimes big butterflies got eyes up
41	48	Okay, now we need to find the piece there. I think this might be it. Let's try that piece	
41	48	I don't know, that's not it	
41	48	'Cause you know why?	
41	48		Yeah because-
41	48	Because this goes somewhere up there	
41	48		Because this supposed to go right here
41	48	Uh-oh, here's the nose, I bet you can fit that piece	
41	48		Oh
41	48	There's the nose. Where does that piece go- Then it's part of the butterfly. Put the blue- turn it around. ###	
41	48		Why do-
41	48		Turn it around- It go with the butterfly right-
41	48	Right, I think it goes like that. Try it that way	
41	48		Yeah
41	48		Try it that way?
41	48	Mm-hmm	
41	48	Does it go that way? Let's see	
41	48		Yeah. Let's see it go up a little bit. Let's see this go up
41	48	No	
41	48		
41	48	Okay	
41	48		We can put- We can um, I think this go right-
41	48	maybe it goes on that side	
41	48		Sometimes something's missing right there
41	48	Something's missing right there. You are right	
41	48		Oh I know. I know mama. It go right- I know mama, because, some points, um, these are not doing good because then those- those will go the other side and the other one's in the way
41	48	The other one is in the way?	
41	48		Uh-huh
41	48	So there's somebody's eye	
41	48		It's supposed to be right here, because I see the butterfly part
41	48	Let's see	
41	48	You're right. It goes right here	
41	48		Yeah
41	48	It looks like it goes there, but it doesn't	
41	48		Yeah, Mama. The nose supposed to be r-i-
41	48	S-	
41	48	I think it's another piece, we gotta find it. Let's-	
41	48		Yeah because, that one don't-
41	48	Oh, here it is, maybe this is it	
41	48		Oh, there it is. Maybe that was it
41	48	Maybe this goes somewhere	
41	48		Maybe we got it wrong
41	48	Right, 'cause there's an ant... right there	
41	48		And the ant supposed to be the other way
41	48	Now where's the other piece? With the butterfly	
41	48		I got it
41	48		Mama
41	48		Where this supposed to be?
41	48	Let's see. This goes there	
41	48		Oh, so the nose go right-
41	48		Oh, Mama. We got it wrong
41	48	### Well this part is right	
41	48		Yeah, that part is wrong
41	48	But	
41	48	This goes... Where?	
41	48		Hmm

41	48		There it is, Mama. High five. We got it
41	48	We got it. Now-	
41	48	Now we got to-	
41	48		I got this one
41	48		
41	48	Let's see	
41	48	Does this slide into here, I think so	
41	48	I think we can slide this into here, like this	
41	48		And
41	48	See?	
41	48		Now, Mama can you move the other pieces?
41	48		Mama, can you move the other p-
41	48	Okay, we'll move some over here	
41	48		But we don't want them to fall
41	48	We don't want them to fall, 'cause we don't want to lose any pieces	
41	48		Yeah
41	48	Okay	
41	48		Now, it go- be careful not to mess up the-
41	48	Okay	
41	48	Okay, so now let's look for that. Here's some more, the- This piece, see if you can fit this piece

44	24	Alright, we just have a few more pieces to go	
44	24	Mmm...	
44	24	There you go, perfect	
44	24		
44	24	One more piece!	
44	24		You do that one
44	24		
44	24	Okay, ready?	
44	24		Here
44	24	*noises* Does it go here?	
44	24		No
44	24	No! Does it go here?	
44	24		No! Here!
44	24	No! Aah	
44	24		
44	24		
44	24	We did it! You wanna go tell her?	
44	24		### Yeah
44	24	Okay	
44	24		Come on
44	24	Let's do it	
44	24	Ready freddy?	
44	24		I wanna go in the little chair
44	24	You ### in the little chair?	
44	24		
44	24	Okay	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
45	24		
45	24	Do you wanna dump it out so we can start it?	
45	24		
45	24		Yeah
45	24	Was this like the one you did in the other room?	
45	24		Yeah, but this- this one is the same size, but harder, I think
45	24	### Okay	
45	24		'Cause it's more creatures
45	24	More creatures?	
45	24		The other one had more grassy stuff, and creatures. It did have animals, but it didn't have as much as this. It wasn't, aah, underwater ###
45	24	Oh, really	
45	24	Okay	
45	24	Wanna help me take it apart?	
45	24		Mmm yeah
45	24		Maybe just flip this whole thing over
45	24		Take this apart
45	24		###
45	24	Should we put the board back?	
45	24		Yeah
45	24		This is a pretty big so ### like this. Words are at the bottom
45	24		
45	24	Just a creaky door	
45	24	Where should we start? How did you figure out how to do the other one?	
45	24		Aah I just maybe figure out how this goes?
45	24	Mm-hmm	
45	24		### but that's not a edge, so we wanna do the edges first
45	24		Here's a corner piece
45	24		It must ### go here
45	24	Okay	
45	24		No it ###
45	24	We don't know which corner it goes in, right?	
45	24		
45	24		I think it's here
45	24	'Kay	
45	24		And a octopus
45	24	Mmm	
45	24		Nah
45	24	That doesn't look quite right	
45	24		Hmm
45	24		Corner
45	24		
45	24	Good	
45	24		Yep
45	24	So we've got one corner with blue, and one corner with some orange and purple	
45	24		Mm-hmm
45	24		Wonder how this will go here?
45	24		
45	24	Good	
45	24		Aah *noises* No
45	24		What's this
45	24		Shark
45	24	Should we try to find more um, with purple?	
45	24		Yeah
45	24		
45	24		Here
45	24	Ooh good	
45	24	'Member that- Remember that piece that you just put in was attached to another piece?	
45	24		Mm-hmm
45	24	Do you think that that's still- That was attached- Do you think that that still should be attached?	
45	24	It was attached to this piece	
45	24		Mmm
45	24	Remember?	
45	24		
45	24	Good	
45	24		We got a whole corner
45	24		This must go here
45	24		Oh no, that um, is looking away from the that thing
45	24		
45	24	Yeah	
45	24	That's true. And it looks like it's an edge, so maybe it goes up against an edge, that piece	
45	24		
45	24	Good	
45	24		That looks like it's looking at the here
45	24	Yes it does	
45	24		###
45	24		*noises*
45	24	Mm-hmm	
45	24		I don't want to get stuck in there, but he doesn't see the shark
45	24	*laughing*	
45	24		So he doesn't know- Nah. Where does that go?
45	24		Aah
45	24		*name* would like that
45	24	Yeah	
45	24		Pink
45	24	What's that called?	
45	24		Seahorse
45	24	Yeah	
45	24	Good, look at that, it's an edge	
45	24		But it has a purple eyeball
45	24	Yeah, but lookit it's blue, do you think it might belong to that one?	
45	24		
45	24	That's good	
45	24		###
45	24	That's good progress	
45	24		
45	24	Oh good	
45	24	It looks like there's something gray up here ### It's a shark? Yeah	
45	24		Shark
45	24		Well it looks like the sea creatures are all heading to here
45	24	It does kind of. Into the middle	
45	24		Like they're having a meeting
45	24	Mm-hmm *laughing*	
45	24	Do you want to work on the shark or that pink- there's seems to be some kind of pink thing up there	
45	24		Yeah, I wanna do the pink thing
45	24	Okay	
45	24		Pink thing
45	24		Ooh, here
45	24	Yeah. Looks like-	
45	24		Like a jellyfish, I think
45	24	Yeah	
45	24		It's a jellyfish. ###
45	24	It looks like there's a bunch of pink pieces over here, yeah	
45	24		Pink pieces
45	24		
45	24		I think it's a jellyfish
45	24	Oh that's good, that even had- you finished the um, seahorse's nose	
45	24		Mm-hmm. I think it's a jellyfish, mom
45	24		
45	24	Yeah, that does look like a jellyfish	
45	24		'Cause it all has- It has all those stinging, stinging things, right momma?
45	24		
45	24	Those tentacles or-	
45	24		Yeah ###
45	24		
45	24		### more purple
45	24		This go here, ###
45	24		
45	24	That's good	
45	24		There's some kind of crab or something
45	24	*laughing* Yeah, I see a pincher	
45	24		Pincher's coming to save the um, creatures from the shark
45	24	*laughing*	
45	24	That looks like it has an edge. I'm wondering if that doesn't go somewhere along the bottom there	
45	24		Mmm
45	24		Mmm
45	24	Maybe try to finish more of the crab and it- you'll figure out where that goes	
45	24		Mm-hmm
45	24	There's a pincher	
45	24		I can't figure this-
45	24	Oh yeah	
45	24	Good	
45	24		This
45	24	I see an edge	
45	24		Yeah
45	24		
45	24		###
45	24	Oh, good	
45	24		Now we need one more crab here
45	24	Good good	
45	24		
45	24		There's that ### the purple and the crab and the-
45	24	That's good	
45	24		Everything. And the starfish is even coming along!
45	24	Yes	
45	24		They slide along the floor
45	24	Mm-hmm	
45	24		Alright now time to work on the sh- scary shark
45	24		
45	24		Scary. Oh *laughing*
45	24	Good, there's his tail	
45	24		Mm-hmm
45	24		
45	24		Right now I need like some kind of sharky piece right here
45	24	Good	
45	24	Mm-hmm	
45	24		
45	24		Then I'm finishing with the dolphin
45	24		He's like "Hey dolphin, we're both swimmers and we both look alike"
45	24		*laughing*
45	24	I'm just gonna check my cell phone	
45	24		
45	24		
45	24		*noises* Whoa, they're all deep under-
45	24	Yeah	
45	24		### the top *laughing*
45	24		
45	24		Whoa, that ### a swordfish
45	24	That's an interesting fish	
45	24	That is, yeah	
45	24	These are sometimes sharp. Sometimes they have teeth here	
45	24		Why does it sometimes have teeth there?
45	24	Well I guess just like any fish, he- he needs to eat and chomp other- other fish up	
45	24		Chomps
45	24		
45	24		
45	24		
45	24	Hey, good!	
45	24		Think that's a whale
45	24	Mm-hmm. Maybe a blue whale	
45	24		I think, yeah. Those are those ones that glide along, I think
45	24	Mm-hmm	
45	24	They can dive really deep underwater, can't they?	
45	24		Yeah
45	24	Do you know what this is?	
45	24		Uh-oh, he's looking at the tentacles
45	24	*laughing* Yeah	
45	24		But he's going up, 'cause he doesn't want to sting this guy
45	24	He's trying to stay out of the way, maybe?	
45	24		Yeah. He's- He knows he has those powers
45	24	Do you know what this is?	
45	24		We finished it before-
45	24	Yeah, before she came back. This one is um, it has a funny name. It's called a sea anemone	
45	24		Why
45	24	Sea anemone	
45	24		Can they move on the floor?
45	24	Aah	
45	24	I think generally they don't, but I'm not really sure. I think they eat by catching- they move these tentacles around and they catch, aah, food as it floats by	
45	24		Like catch a dead fish?
45	24	Catch it and then try to eat it in here	
45	24		Catch a dead fish or something that floats
45	24	Yeah, or maybe some rally really small-	
45	24	Umm	
45	24		Like, like some of those fishes might swim down here, and ###
45	24	Mm-hmm	
45	24	It'll catch 'em	
45	24	Eat 'em	
45	24	'Kay	
45	24		And the shark's looking like he'll bite him and bring him down to here, right?
45	24	Mm-hmm	
45	24	And do you remember what blue whales eat from when you studied them last year?	
45	24	Remember? It's the little- They're- I think they're like little shrimp?	
45	24		Yeah
45	24	And do you remember the w- name for that?	
45	24		They're ### I can't remember
45	24	Krill, I think they're called	
45	24		Krill! Yeah, krill
45	24	I wonder if we should tell her we're done ### tell her	
45	24		
45	24		So I'll have to do one with her again and then I'll get the toy?
45	24	*laughing* I think we're-	
45	48		
45	48	Ooh! You know what? Lookit the pieces are smaller	
45	48		Yeah. *noises* That's way more pieces than we just did
45	48		
45	48	It is. This looks like a complicated one. Let's look at the picture first	
45	48	So you can rem- sort of try to remember what's where	
45	48		I wanna try to work on here
45	48	The beautiful toucan	
45	48	So there's a blue butterfly here, and a-	
45	48		Yeah, you can- You- I'll do this, you do this
45	48	Okay	
45	48		###
45	48	Do you wanna-	
45	48	Do you wanna- yeah	
45	48		Whoa it really came out!
45	48	It did. It came out in one solid piece. But let's take it apart and um, separate the pieces	
45	48		*noises*
45	48		So I have to two- do two games with her and then I get the toy?
45	48	Mm-hmm I think so	
45	48		*noises* Is that really gonna be one whole hour?
45	48		One hour?
45	48	Aah, I think the- the two games you're gonna play with her will take less than an hour	
45	48		
45	48	But all together the amount of time we'll be here is about an hour	
45	48		Yeah. 'Kay *sigh*
45	48		How- Why was it only just puzzle and puzzle and puzzles?
45	48	I think they're learning something about how you solve- solve puzzles and how you-	
45	48	How you work	
45	48	Aah, but I think next time we're gonna do something with books. Today it's puzzles	
45	48		Like, when I'm five or six or s- I might be six or-
45	48	I think we're coming- I think it's next weekend, and you're gonna be a little bit closer to five, but still not five quite yet	
45	48		Like two, two day- two days and one, and like three weeks? Or something?
45	48	Yeah, I think Poppa said yesterday that you're three days and two weeks away	
45	48	Maybe now you're only two days and two weeks away from being-	
45	48	So where do you wanna start?	
45	48	You said you wanted to start with the toucan?	
45	48		Yeah
45	48	Should we try to find pieces of him?	
45	48		*noises*
45	48		Like, I think some pieces of him- Here are the butterflies
45	48	You wanna start with that?	
45	48		Yeah
45	48		### somewhere here, yeah
45	48	Where- What else are some butterfly pieces?	
45	48		There and there
45	48	That one, okay	
45	48	Yep	
45	48		And there
45	48	Okay	
45	48		And there
45	48	All the blue- That's a very- it's easy to see the blue isn't it?	
45	48		And here
45	48	Oh, another one. Yep, good	
45	48		That's a lot of butterfly pieces
45	48	it is	
45	48		It's 'cause they're small, so, that does not go there
45	48	Oh good corner	
45	48		
45	48	It makes things easier when you find a corner piece	
45	48		Yeah so we ### along the edges
45	48		
45	48		
45	48	Yeah	
45	48		*noises*
45	48		
45	48		*noises*
45	48		Does this go here?
45	48	I think it does. It's aah, just a little bit-	
45	48		
45	48		###
45	48	It's a little bit stuck, I think. Yeah, there	
45	48		Alright now here, It's one big butterfly
45	48		
45	48		Big butterfly
45	48	Yes it is	
45	48		Very...
45	48		Unusual *laughing*
45	48		
45	48	What's that?	
45	48		
45	48		The tiger's mouth
45	48	*laughing*	
45	48		They have mouths like that, and so do lions
45	48	###	
45	48		They have big noses, they have really good sense. Really big, and really good senses
45	48		Some big animals don't have good senses ###
45	48		### Come on
45	48	Good, that looks like the whole butterfly	
45	48		
45	48		Sure is. Yep, sure is
45	48	Should we keep working on the tiger since-	
45	48		Yeah
45	48	Or the leopard?	
45	48		###
45	48	That looks- Yep	
45	48	Want me to help you collect the pieces?	
45	48		###
45	48		Oh that's some kind of sna-
45	48	I'm gonna give you ones with spots	
45	48		Okay
45	48		I can't figure this-
45	48	Hmm, it looks like part of an eye	
45	48		Yeah
45	48		Like somehow here?
45	48	That might be the other eye?	
45	48	Do you think?	
45	48	### 'Cause he's gonna have two eyes, I think	
45	48		These are ###
45	48		
45	48	That's good	
45	48		###
45	48		
45	48	Good	
45	48		Now he looks serious
45	48	*laughing* He does	
45	48		Is it a tiger or not a tiger?
45	48	I think it's a leopard, when they have spots like that, I think that's a leopard	
45	48		
45	48		A leopard. Are those leopards fast?
45	48	Yes	
45	48		Leopards are fast, yeah. They have big strong legs, too ###
45	48		###
45	48		That go here? Think
45	48		Does-
45	48	Mmm, I don't know	
45	48		###
45	48	We still need to finish the top of his head. Oh that's good, that's the side of his head	
45	48		
45	48		Top of his head
45	48		
45	48	That's good	
45	48		Now there's that swinging
45	48	Mm-hmm	
45	48		###
45	48		*noises*
45	48	You know what's funny, I see? Those look like the little aah, feet of a frog, maybe? Or a- some other creature	
45	48		Hmm
45	48		A snail ###
45	48	Maybe we should look for more of those	
45	48		Mmm
45	48		Don't see-
45	48	Or do you wanna try another corner?	
45	48		Um, try another corner. There are three more corners and aah, three more edges
45	48	Can you find a corner piece?	
45	48		No we have one more edge, we have one more edge! 'Cause we already started on this, and this, but not this
45	48	Mm-hmm	
45	48	###	
45	48		*noises*
45	48		###
45	48	There's a lot of green here. We might want to choose a strategy. Either do corners, do edges-	
45	48	Try to finish up the mushrooms here, maybe? You see these mushrooms?	
45	48		Mmm, yeah
45	48		I found more ### *noises*
45	48	Oh, more hands? Yeah	
45	48		More hands to some kind of-
45	48		
45	48	Well that's good	
45	48		###
45	48	I think that might be a frog. Do you see any more pieces that look like that?	
45	48		Frog
45	48		No
45	48		Surprisingly not- Oh here
45	48		Is some frog
45	48		This must go-
45	48	I can't see that whole piece. What kind of piece is that?	
45	48		A corner!
45	48	Yeah	
45	48		It must go up-
45	48	That's a good guess	
45	48		Or
45	48	Mmm then- I think the one you chose was good because otherwise he'll be upside-down	
45	48		And this wouldn't work
45	48	That's right. That wouldn't work	
45	48		So
45	48		
45	48	Do you see any other froggy pieces?	
45	48		Mmm
45	48		More tentacle things
45	48		###
45	48	I don't think that's the same-	
45	48		Yeah, those have big dots
45	48	Right	
45	48		Those are some kind of snail
45	48		###
45	48		Aah
45	48	What about these, are those frog pieces?	
45	48		Okay
45	48		
45	48		Yeah
45	48		
45	48	Good	
45	48		Now I need a ### here
45	48		We're done with the ### *noises*
45	48	You know what we started to- we started to do I think over here? Do you see this?	
45	48		Mm-hmm
45	48		
45	48	Pretty red	
45	48		Mm-hmm
45	48	Do you think we could find more ### pieces?	
45	48		Ant, red ants ###
45	48	Those- Do you see- I feel like that's a little bit of a different color red. This is more of a bright red- Yes	
45	48		Pinky-red
45	48	And I wonder if some of these go in that area	
45	48	That's good, you're looking for an edge	
45	48	Maybe it goes somewhere along the top?	
45	48		
45	48	Good	
45	48		Alright, this... not a edge
45	48		### goes along here
45	48		No
45	48	It's not an edge? Oh, okay	
45	48		Here's the-
45	48	Here's one that might be an edge	
45	48		Yes
45	48	Oh and you found another edge, that's good	
45	48		This is littler ###
45	48		### go here
45	48	Aah, I don't think that quite fits. Do you see how there's that other color there?	
45	48	Try this- Try this over here	
45	48		###
45	48		Alright
45	48		
45	48		Yeah and this-
45	48	Oh good	
45	48	There you go	
45	48		
45	48		Someone poured some red
45	48	Yeah	
45	48	Do you see any more of that bright pinky-red?	
45	48		Here
45	48	Yeah	
45	48		So, no it doesn't go there
45	48		
45	48	That's good	
45	48		It goes there ###
45	48		*noises* Here's some more of that red-pink
45	48	Yeah, but that looks like a different plant now, doesn't it?	
45	48		Yeah, and, I'm not sure where that-
45	48		Are we having a missing piece?
45	48		Do you have any on your seat?
45	48	Mmm nope	
45	48		###
45	48	What are you looking for?	
45	48		We're looking for more of those right here
45	48	That one? Keep looking here, there might be a little bit more of that pinky-red, and with a little bit of our leopard in it	
45	48	So it looks like we have a little bit of leopard ear to finish	
45	48		Alright, well, the leopard ear is what we're looking for
45	48		I think we're missing a piece
45	48	You know what I- I think I see it	
45	48		###
45	48		Where? Can you take it-
45	48		Yeah
45	48		Leopard ear here
45	48		
45	48	Do you know what? Now that I think about it, we're-	
45	48	Does it fit? Good. Aah, I don't think we finished the other leopard ear completely	
45	48		Yeah
45	48		Mmm
45	48	Some orange	
45	48		*noises*
45	48	Yeah, there's some interesting kind of orange and-	
45	48		Greeny
45	48	Yeah	
45	48		White ###
45	48		*noises* Darker red, like the red ant. Does this one look like the same red as ###
45	48	The red and looks a little different, what if we worked on the mushrooms?	
45	48		*noises* Yeah
45	48		
45	48	And then here's- I found another mushroom	
45	48		*noises* What's that green thing?
45	48	And then-	
45	48		
45	48	And then who's legs does that look like that might be?	
45	48		Red
45	48	Should we work on the ant?	
45	48		Yeah
45	48	I think we might have figured out that- where the ant goes	
45	48		Found this. Found that. No, that doesn't go there
45	48		
45	48		###
45	48		This is not it
45	48		###
45	48	Are there any edge pieces that are ant related?	
45	48		I don't know
45	48	Yeah	
45	48	That's good	
45	48		Mmkay, ### more with the belly
45	48		
45	48	Yeah, good	
45	48		###
45	48		No
45	48		This one-
45	48	Here's one too	
45	48		
45	48		Yep, those are his legs alright
45	48	Good	
45	48		He's carrying something
45	48	Yeah? Looks like he's got a leaf in his mouth	
45	48		What's that green, slimy-
45	48	I don't know, maybe that's moss or something	
45	48		Yeah, I think it's moss
45	48		### moss
45	48	I think we're not quite ready for that piece	
45	48		Moss ###
45	48	Yeah	
45	48	Good	
45	48		
45	48		Now could we do it?
45	48	Now he has a friend following him there?	
45	48		###
45	48	Oh good	
45	48		They're both carrying something
45	48	Yeah	
45	48		### Those are the guard ants with their big biters out
45	48		
45	48	Look- Yeah, look at that	
45	48		'Cause yeah ### 'Cause red ants bite
45	48	They're carrying leaves	
45	48		*noises* Cheetahs are faster than- Are cheetahs faster than these?
45	48	Cheetahs faster than ants?	
45	48		No, cheetahs faster than leopards
45	48	Oh, yeah that could be a-	
45	48		I think, like, I think cheetahs have stripes
45	48	A cheetah	
45	48	Could be	
45	48		But that might be a cheetah
45	48	Yeah	
45	48		I think it's a cheetah
45	48	So	
45	48	Let's, Aah, I'm not sure where we should start next	
45	48		Um, we're- ants
45	48	Let's-	
45	48		'Cause ### There's only two ants?
45	48	You know what, this- This to me, See this red here? I wonder if that could possibly go there	
45	48		
45	48		Yeah
45	48		
45	48	Good, and now we have a start on the, um, orange	
45	48	Do you see that pretty orange? Maybe we could start working on that	
45	48		Yeah
45	48		
45	48	Good	
45	48		It's a flower
45	48		It's a flower
45	48		Very nice flower
45	48		
45	48	Good	
45	48		It's a very pretty flower. But there's still some more missing those things
45	48	It is	
45	48	Yes, a little bit of orange	
45	48		*noises*
45	48	And, you know- see this?	
45	48		I see it I-
45	48		### the orange ###
45	48	That	
45	48	###	
45	48		
45	48		That goes over in there
45	48	Oh good	
45	48		Here's the, um, parrot
45	48	Good	
45	48		
45	48		Right
45	48		Mmm
45	48	Oh, I see the start of some pink, that pretty pink flower	
45	48		### the flowers
45	48		Not sure how this works
45	48	What if it goes over on the side	
45	48		Yeah
45	48	And here's another pink piece	
45	48		
45	48		Pink ###
45	48		
45	48	Good	
45	48		Alright *noises*
45	48		
45	48		He's eating a berry
45	48	Yes	
45	48		His tongue is slurping out there
45	48		*noises*
45	48		We're almost done
45	48	Yep	
45	48		See if there's some more of-
45	48	Do you know what I think I'm starting to see, is the pink, the red tips of these pink flowers, do you wanna-

45	48		
45	48	Good Good	
45	48		We need to work on that ### green thing
45	48		###
45	48		This is a edge
45	48	Should we get the edge pieces together and try to sort that out?	
45	48		Mmm
45	48		Figuring this out
45	48		
45	48	Good	
45	48		This ### of that white
45	48		###

45	48	One more time?	
45	48	Good	
45	48

45	48		
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
47	24		
47	24	*laughing* Ready? Okay, go ahead	
47	24	Whoa	
47	24		
47	24		Ow
47	24	Did it get ya?	
47	24		Yeah!
47	24	### break them up	
47	24	You can start first, what should we do first?	
47	24		The corners. You do the corners, I do the sides
47	24	You want me to do the corners?	
47	24		Uh-huh
47	24	###	
47	24	Can you help me find 'em?	
47	24		*noises* This
47	24	How many corners do we have?	
47	24		One, Two, Three, Four
47	24	Okay, so let's-	
47	24		Corner! Corner!
47	24	Is that a corner? Okay, give me another one	
47	24		Mmm, corner, corner, corner
47	24	We need four, so here's one	
47	24	Let's find the other ones	
47	24		Aah, c-
47	24		
47	24	Is this one?	
47	24		Yeah
47	24	Okay. I think that one goes there. We need the other ones	
47	24		
47	24		Yeah. There's two more *noises*
47	24	That one?	
47	24		Right there
47	24	You think so?	
47	24		Yeah
47	24	Okay	
47	24		And the next one
47	24	*noises*	
47	24	You see it?	
47	24		Mm-mm. Mmm
47	24	Is that it?	
47	24	Mmkay	
47	24		
47	24		###
47	24	Let's see if that works!	
47	24		A shark
47	24	Mmm	
47	24	What is that?	
47	24		It's a bird
47	24	Is that part of him?	
47	24		Nah, it's- Yeah, part
47	24	His beak?	
47	24	Right?	
47	24	I think this one- Doesn't that look like a shark?	
47	24	I think we have the wrong corners	
47	24		
47	24		Mixed up
47	24		
47	24	Yeah	
47	24	Does that look better?	
47	24		Mm-hmm
47	24		
47	24	Okay	
47	24	No	
47	24	What is that?	
47	24		Aah, a starfish
47	24	Starfish	
47	24		A fish
47	24	Let's see if there's more starfish in here	
47	24		
47	24	Oh, good job	
47	24		
47	24	He's pink, like him, right?	
47	24		Mm-hmm
47	24	Like that?	
47	24		
47	24		
47	24	Oh, good job	
47	24	What's that?	
47	24		### *noises*
47	24	There's his body	
47	24		
47	24	Good	
47	24		Should- The shark's mouth should go here, right?
47	24	That looks like part of the shark, alright. See if it fits	
47	24	Well how did you- That's- piece has to go in one of those, right?	
47	24		### this piece
47	24	Mmm, doesn't fit on that piece	
47	24		
47	24	Does it fit on that piece? Yeah?	
47	24		Mmm... Oh yeah!
47	24	Are there any pieces underneath? No, okay. We're good	
47	24	###	
47	24	No, what about here?	
47	24	Oh, it wasn't a bird, that was a swordfish	
47	24		
47	24		Is- Oh it's a swordfish
47	24	Right I thought that was a bird	
47	24	No ### where that goes. Oh there's- No	
47	24	That's not a end piece	
47	24	Here's a end piece	
47	24		
47	24		Mmm
47	24		Where does this go?
47	24		
47	24	Mmm, good	
47	24	So I'm gonna find more end pieces	
47	24	So we can do the outside, okay?	
47	24	I think that one goes like	
47	24		
47	24	There's more end- These are end pieces	
47	24		
47	24	### goes at the edge	
47	24	I don't think that fits there	
47	24	Does that look like it goes together?	
47	24	Hmm?	
47	24		Mm-hmm
47	24	What's that part of?	
47	24		Oh, I don't know
47	24	I don't think that goes together	
47	24		
47	24		Where does this go?
47	24	I don't know. Here's the two end- end pieces	
47	24		But where should this go?
47	24		Here?
47	24	Well, does it fit on either one of them? Try it	
47	24	Does it fit there?	
47	24		No
47	24	'Kay	
47	24		
47	24	Does it fit there? Okay	
47	24		And this one should fit ###
47	24		
47	24	Does it?	
47	24		There
47	24	What is that?	
47	24		A crab
47	24	Where's the other ### crab?	
47	24	Hmm, what's that?	
47	24		His eye
47	24	So is his eye up there?	
47	24		No
47	24		
47	24	Good	
47	24	Aah... ### What are those?	
47	24		His
47	24	His? Here, give 'em to him	
47	24		There's two octopuses
47	24		That doesn't fit how about this?
47	24		No, how about I do this?
47	24		
47	24	I think that's perfect	
47	24	Who is that?	
47	24		A shark
47	24	Uh-huh, give him back- give ### to the shark	
47	24		
47	24	Hmm, what else?	
47	24		This is a part of the swordfish, right
47	24	Mmm yeah, but I don't think it goes like that, does it?	
47	24		### there
47	24	Was the swordfish down there?	
47	24		Mmm
47	24		### there
47	24		
47	24	Good	
47	24		This goes here
47	24	I thought that was part of the swordfish	
47	24		Oh, yeah
47	24		This
47	24		Or maybe...
47	24		###
47	24		Where does this go right here
47	24		
47	24	Ooh, god	
47	24		###
47	24	### turn it around	
47	24		
47	24		
47	24	Nice job	
47	24	You gonna let her know we're done?	
47	24		Mmm
47	24	And she's in the other room that you were in with her	
47	24		Mmm
47	24		
47	24	Hmm? Did you like that one?	
47	24		Mmm yeah
47	24	Ready for another one?	
47	24	Whoa. Look at that. What's on here?	
47	48		
47	48		Awesome
47	48		A- A parrot, a frog
47	48		Aah, aah, it's- um, aah, aah, a koala bear? A sloth
47	48		
47	48	Sloth	
47	48		Snake
47	48		Cheetah
47	48		Butterfly
47	48		Ants
47	48	Okay, we gotta remember this, 'cause this is a lot more pieces, right?	
47	48	Are you ready?	
47	48		How?
47	48		How there's-
47	48	'Cause they're smaller	
47	48	Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready? *noises*	
47	48		Yeah yeah yeah yeah
47	48		They're a lot
47	48	There's lots	
47	48	Okay let's break 'em up	
47	48		And lots
47	48		Mash 'em and mash 'em. These ones are toughies
47	48		They're even smaller
47	48	*noises*	
47	48		They're- they're tough
47	48		I think the butterflies are holding them together
47	48	Yeah?	
47	48		What's holding them together?
47	48		They're like snapping. You do the corners, I do the sides
47	48		
47	48	Okay. Corners and sides, right? Let's find 'em all first	
47	48	Is that a corner an- or a side?	
47	48		A side
47	48	Okay, so let's get all the corners and sides in one pile	
47	48	Is this a corner or a side?	
47	48		It's a side
47	48	Is it?	
47	48		Yeah
47	48	What makes it a side?	
47	48		Because it doesn't have any corners
47	48	So why is this a side?	
47	48		Because it doesn't have any corners
47	48	Oh *laughing*	
47	48	How 'bout let's get the corners first, yeah?	
47	48		Yeah
47	48	Find a corner	
47	48		Corner
47	48	Thank you	
47	48	I think it goes there	
47	48		Aah, corner, corner, corner, corner, corner
47	48	Is that a corner?	
47	48		Yeah
47	48	Okay. I think it goes here	
47	48		
47	48	How many more do we need?	
47	48		Aah
47	48		One, two
47	48	Okay. Oh!	
47	48		
47	48	One more	
47	48		*noises*
47	48	I see, it's under your arm	
47	48		Where, where?
47	48	It's in here, somewhere	
47	48		###
47	48		Oh, found it! *laughing*
47	48	Yep, thank you	
47	48		
47	48	Okay, now we gotta get the sides, and these are the sides, see how it's flat?	
47	48		mm-hmm
47	48	Those are the sides. So is this a side?	
47	48		Mm-mm
47	48	No, okay, so let's get all the sides	
47	48		
47	48	Those are sides, is this a side?	
47	48	###	
47	48	Okay	
47	48		Mmm
47	48		*sigh* ###
47	48		
47	48	Yep, perfect	
47	48	Okay, more sides. What's that part of, remember?	
47	48		A butterfly!
47	48	Okay, so let's do the butterfly	
47	48	Sides, right?	
47	48	Good	
47	48	Try the other- Try the other way	
47	48		###
47	48	See?	
47	48		Oh!
47	48	Here's another butterfly side	
47	48	Does that look like it's right?	
47	48		Mmm
47	48	Does this look like it's right?	
47	48		Mm-hmm
47	48	Does that fit in the corner?	
47	48		Mm-mm
47	48	Mm-mm	
47	48		Mm-mm
47	48	That needs to stay in the corner. So now where do these guys go?	
47	48		
47	48		Mm-hmm
47	48	Here's another butterfly side	
47	48		*noises* 
47	48	How 'bout here?	
47	48		
47	48	It's a side, right? So where should it be?	
47	48		Here
47	48	On an edge	
47	48		
47	48		
47	48		
47	48		*laughing*
47	48	Okay	
47	48	What other sides do we have here?	
47	48	Anything that might look like it's next to that?	
47	48		Wait! Wait wait wait wait
47	48	Ooh, you found the inside of the butterfly?	
47	48		###
47	48		
47	48	Good job	
47	48	Good job	
47	48		*noises* *gasp*
47	48	This?	
47	48	Mmm	
47	48	I don't think so	
47	48	What about right there?	
47	48		No-
47	48		Because that's where the leopard goes
47	48	Yeah but that doesn't- Lookit, here, put that in there	
47	48	Does that fit?	
47	48		Mm-hmm
47	48	Is that where the butterfly ends? See how it goes?	
47	48	But watch	
47	48	### get that one back in there. Now is that the butterfly?	
47	48		
47	48		Okay, where's the-
47	48	What are you looking for now?	
47	48	This one?	
47	48		What?
47	48	Nothing. Do you think that's where it goes?	
47	48		
47	48		Where does this piece go?
47	48		
47	48		I don't wanna do this puzzle anymore
47	48	*laughing* Why?	
47	48		I just don't
47	48	You're done? Well let's finish it then, okay?	
47	48		
47	48	Try that one. Oh, good. Remember the edge has to go against the side	
47	48	That- Yeah	
47	48	Good job	
47	48		
47	48		Where does this go?
47	48	Aah, it's an edge, so it doesn't go in the middle. See that?	
47	48	So it has to go across the end somewhere	
47	48	Does it fit there?	
47	48		
47	48	There you go	
47	48		Where does this go?
47	48	I don't know where it goes	
47	48	I don't think it fits there though, does it?	
47	48		How 'bout here?
47	48	Mmm, try it	
47	48		
47	48	Yep	
47	48	These go together, I don't know where they go yet, though. Maybe here?	
47	48		Let's see
47	48	'Cause there's a little bit of pink, right? Isn't there a little pink?	
47	48		
47	48	Good job	
47	48		Mmm
47	48		Mmm
47	48		
47	48	Hmm	
47	48	Oh, yeah, that's right	
47	48		
47	48	I don't think that's right

5	24		
5	24	What do we see?	
5	24		See *noises*
5	24	Okay so what are the animals that we see?	
5	24		A shark
5	24		
5	24	A shark	
5	24		Octopus
5	24	What's that?	
5	24		Squid
5	24	Is that a squid? What's this guy?	
5	24		Crab
5	24	What's this guy?	
5	24		Uhh
5	24		Whale
5	24	A seahorse	
5	24	Oh, no the whale's underneath. Good, alright. What's this guy? You know what this is	
5	24		Jellyfish
5	24	Jellyfish. And what's this guy called?	
5	24		A swordfish
5	24	Swordfish. Okay so you-	
5	24		This, shark
5	24	That's a shark. Rah! He looks like a happy shark, though, huh?	
5	24	Alright, so let's take it apart	
5	24		You know what's a good way? Just dumping it
5	24	Just dump it? Okay let's do it	
5	24		Yeah
5	24	*noises* Oh, but see	
5	24		###
5	24	We still have to mix all the pieces up	
5	24		I'm mixing 'em up
5	24	Gotta mix 'em up	
5	24	Do it	
5	24		I think
5	24	What's that? That's, that's, yeah, that's not playing fair if we keep them linked, right?	
5	24		Hey, Mommy, I think you can have to do this on your own 
5	24		
5	24	Yeah?	
5	24	I have to do this on my own?	
5	24		Because I'm gonna be- Because I can't- probably cant do this
5	24	I think you can. I think we can do it together, how about that?	
5	24		Okay
5	24		I think that this piece goes here
5	24	And you can help me	
5	24		And this piece goes here
5	24	Why do you think that that piece goes? Oh because it was on the bottom! Hey, I think that's good!	
5	24	Good logic. Okay	
5	24		This piece goes h-
5	24	Okay well this is, Oh because it's part of the shark?	
5	24	Let's see if that fits	
5	24		###
5	24	Uhh, ooh. You know what I think that's a different piece of the shark but let's keep them nearby each other just in case, Okay?	
5	24		Hey! I- I know where this goes
5	24	Ooh	
5	24		I think it goes
5	24	*gasp* Wait a minute, is it over- *gasp*	
5	24	What about there? That looks like two eyes	
5	24		Hmm
5	24	Is that- Oh, hey! See, look! You're making progress. Let's look for other pieces of the shark	
5	24	What color's the shark?	
5	24		Gray
5	24	Gray; let's look for pieces that have gray	
5	24		Hey! Look
5	24	Oh, there's purple, so that's	
5	24		And purple ###
5	24	And orange. Oh, but you know what? This guy's got a knob here so he doesn't go flat	
5	24	So, which way do you think he goes?	
5	24		
5	24	I, uh, I think	
5	24	What about this one?	
5	24		Oh yeah
5	24	Oh	
5	24		
5	24	There ya go, Oh!	
5	24	I see tentacles. Do you think maybe	
5	24		I don't ###
5	24	You think this would hit, fit here?	
5	24		Yeah
5	24	Okay. So we'll try that. Oh, look we've got a little, we've got an edge and an edge so that's gonna help us	
5	24		
5	24		And you- I just have a couple pieces. You have a lot of pieces
5	24	Yeah well I'm gonna give you these pieces; I'm gonna share them with you	
5	24		###
5	24	I'm not like hogging the pieces	
5	24		Hogging
5	24	*laughing* Okay You know what let me bring the puzzle closer	
5	24		Mommy
5	24	And then you can put the pieces in	
5	24		###
5	24	*gasp* Hey! Great job!	
5	24		
5	24	Awesome	
5	24		You can- you can
5	24	Hey, I found another gray piece. Do you think this goes with the shark?

5	24		### I think it goes here
5	24	You think it goes there?	
5	24	Really? Even with this, with this flat side? It won't link to anything. When we have to flats what does it do?	
5	24		Hey!
5	24	Umm You're closer. I think you're getting warm	
5	24		Well
5	24	What's that? That looks like a tentacle

5	24	Mmm, you sure?	
5	24		Yep

5	24	You can try it	
5	24		It goes to the shark
5	24	It goes to the shark?	
5	24	Ooh, I don't think it does	
5	24		Think it goes to the whale?
5	24	I think maybe it goes to the whale	
5	24		I think it goes right
5	24		No
5	24	No?	
5	24	Mmkay	
5	24	Mmm, I don't think that one's gonna work	
5	24	Mmm, I don't think that one's gonna work	
5	24	Good trying though. Let's put that guy over to the side, and we'll figure out, maybe, we'll figure out where he goes. What about this guy?	
5	24		No
5	24		Oh!
5	24		I forgot
5	24	*laughs*	
5	24	Do you think he's there? Or do you think it's a little, the other side

5	24		Pink! And pink too
5	24		
5	24	And pink too, so that puts together our jellyfish	
5	24	Mmkay	
5	24	I think we're getting closer to knowing	
5	24	What, where that mystery piece goes	
5	24	Oh. Do you see flat?	
5	24		No
5	24	Where does the flat side go?	
5	24	No no no, You were right, You were in your right spot. But make sure the flat can go against the flat	
5	24		
5	24	Right on, baby	
5	24		I don't think this
5	24	Hmm	
5	24	I don't think it's there	
5	24		No

5	48		Nope
5	48	So I don't know if it will go over there

5	48		It goes
5	48	Oops, Sorry, baby	
5	48		See?
5	48		See?
5	48	I don't think so 'cause look at this flat piece. It can't connect to anything else	
5	48		###
5	48		
5	48	I think that, mmm	
5	48		I wanna go now
5	48	In a minute. Can we finish putting this together and then we can go

5	48	Alright, let's see. Where's the rest of this cheetah head?	
5	48		*noises*
5	48	Mmm	
5	48	You think that's it? Or do you think that's the top of his head? What's this look like?	
5	48		###
5	48		A nose
5	48	A nose. So where- How do we make his nose fit with his nose?	
5	48		
5	48	Rock on	
5	48		Oh I need to build my friends
5	48	You need to build your friends	
5	48	*noises*

5	48	And, Oh man this is hard. Mommy's having trouble with this one	
5	48		Yeah, I think we'll tell her
5	48	Oh no	
5	48	I think we can keep trying. For a little while

5	48	Let's find some more cheetah pieces. You think there's some more?

50	48	Mmkay. Now what do we do first?	
50	48		I want this one
50	48	Okay, that's a middle piece, right?	
50	48		So-
50	48	So, what should we do first?	
50	48		We should do this one
50	48		We should do this one
50	48	How 'bout we try to find the corners first? That's a good one, that's an edge. and then we'll do edges next	
50	48		###
50	48		It goes here
50	48	Does it? I don't remember where it goes, but let's get the corners	
50	48		Aah, here
50	48	Well, this has a flat side, right?	
50	48		
50	48		So it goes on the bottom?
50	48	It goes somewhere along the edge. So let's find the corners, can we find the corners?	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48		Mmm
50	48	Do you see any corner- Is that a corner piece?	
50	48	Do those go together that way?	
50	48	I don't think that that matches. Do you think that matches?	
50	48	Well that's not a corner. But I think you're right that they go together	
50	48		But this one goes together with that one
50	48	Is that an edge piece? Oh good job	
50	48		Goes on botto- It goes like that
50	48	so we have to figure out which way is up	
50	48		This one's up
50	48	Okay, let's find the corners. Do you see any other corners? There should be four corners, right?	
50	48	Oh that's a good edge	
50	48	Ooh, nice!	
50	48		Oh look! *laughing*
50	48		###
50	48		Look at this
50	48	Well this has a flat side, right? So where does that go?	
50	48		Aah
50	48	Nice. Is it sticky?	
50	48	There it goes	
50	48		Where does this go?
50	48	I don't know. He's a middle piece though, so why don't we get the edges and the corners first, and then we'll try to figure out which way this goes	
50	48		###
50	48		Ooh
50	48		*laughing*
50	48	Well that's part of this guy, isn't it?	
50	48		*laughing* Yeah. I found ### the eye. There's an eye
50	48	Okay let's- Let's finish the edges though, b-	
50	48	Let's finish the edges. Did you find any more corners?	
50	48	I don't see any more corners	
50	48		Oh! This one doesn't have an edge
50	48	That one doesn't have an edge. This one has an edge	
50	48		Oh yeah. where does this go?
50	48	I don't know	
50	48		*laughing* Oh I know where that goes
50	48	You do?	
50	48		I almost got it
50	48		###
50	48	Does it go over here?	
50	48		I think it goes-
50	48	Did you try it?	
50	48		I think it goes here
50	48		
50	48	Oh good job	
50	48		It goes on bottom!
50	48	Nice. I think this is part of the toucan	
50	48		### does that
50	48		There's a toucan in there?
50	48	Yeah, we might have s- We might have mixed this up, but okay let's keep looking	
50	48		We didn't mix that up
50	48	Let's look for the corners. We need three more corners. 'Member a corner piece, it has this edge on two sides	
50	48	Do you see any?	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	Oh there's one	
50	48		But that one-
50	48	We'll have to figure out where it goes	
50	48	Do you think it goes over there?	
50	48		
50	48		I think so
50	48	Okay. What about other corner pieces?	
50	48		###
50	48		This one has a corner
50	48	Yeah?	
50	48	Do those go togeth- That's an edge, right?	
50	48		So it goes there
50	48		
50	48	Nice	
50	48	Pretty orchids	
50	48		Pretty orchids ###
50	48	Yeah. Alright, what else?	
50	48	That's a middle piece, so let's wait on that one	
50	48		*laughing* Yeah
50	48	Do you see any other-	
50	48	Oh who's this guy?	
50	48		He's a koala
50	48	I think he's a sloth	
50	48		### sloth, well it's koala
50	48	###	
50	48		### koala sloth
50	48	You think it's a koala?	
50	48		It's a koala sloth
50	48	*laughing* a koala sloth?	
50	48		Yeah, koalas- This one is a koala sloth, so it has- it has a little gray and a little green
50	48	Oh	
50	48		Look, this is a part of his hand
50	48	Where's the other corner pieces? We need two more corner pieces	
50	48	Oh you got that together?	
50	48	Aah	
50	48	Mmm, I don't think it goes like that	
50	48	Does it go on the bottom?	
50	48	Hmm, is this an edge?	
50	48		*gasp* That's his feet ###
50	48	Is this- I think this goes up at the top	
50	48	Try it right there	
50	48	We got it. Good job	
50	48		
50	48	Okay	
50	48		###
50	48	Is there another edge?	
50	48	Another corner?	
50	48	Oh there's a corner	
50	48	Hmm. You think it goes there?	
50	48		### here
50	48		I think that's where the cheetah goes
50	48	Hmm	
50	48	Might be	
50	48	Where does this piece go?	
50	48		I don't know
50	48	Where's the red stuff?	
50	48	Mmm, this is an edge though, so maybe, does this go along the edge?	
50	48		Does it go like this?
50	48	Maybe	
50	48	Now where does it go? Along the edge?	
50	48	Nice!	
50	48		Then where does-
50	48	Are there any other corners?	
50	48		*gasp* I think this goes
50	48	I think it might	
50	48	Flip	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	Nice one	
50	48		Did it, we did it
50	48	We did it	
50	48		*gasp* toucan
50	48	I'm wondering if we mixed this up though	
50	48		Toucan
50	48	Is that part of the toucan?	
50	48	Flip it maybe?	
50	48	Keep trying	
50	48	Nice	
50	48	Oh you know what? I think that goes up here	
50	48	Top. Up at the tippy top	
50	48		Up the tippy top?
50	48		
50	48		I can't even do that
50	48	You can't?	
50	48		
50	48		I ###
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	Where does that one go in?	
50	48		
50	48	Nice! Good job	
50	48		### knew those his feathers I thought. I thought that was his feathers *gasp*
50	48	Okay	
50	48	So does the sloth go somewhere else?	
50	48		Did you know-
50	48		### sloth goes-
50	48	You think he goes there?	
50	48	Where do you think he goes?	
50	48		No
50	48	Hmm, put him- Put those two back together. Are there any other sloth pieces?	
50	48		He needs his feet *gasp*
50	48		
50	48	He needs his feet?	
50	48	Ooh, okay. Where do you think that goes?	
50	48		He goes up here. See I told you
50	48	Can you put it in?	
50	48	Fit one side, and then the other	
50	48		
50	48	Nice!	
50	48		See, I told you he can fit on there
50	48	You're right. And then is there a piece that goes here, to link these two together?	
50	48		Oh
50	48	What do you think?	
50	48		### I can't find it
50	48	Hmm, alright. Well keep looking	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	What other pieces are there?	
50	48		Feet
50	48	This is a butterfly. Maybe the butterfly goes over here	
50	48	What do you think?	
50	48		Feet
50	48	Feet, hmm. I haven't seen a frog yet	
50	48		Here's a frog face
50	48	Yeah, but I haven't seen where he goes, have you?	
50	48		There's no edges on there
50	48	Hmm	
50	48		This one has an edge
50	48	Is that part of the butterfly?	
50	48	Nope	
50	48		###
50	48	Do those match?	
50	48		### this one
50	48	Try- Wait, try the other side. Try the other side	
50	48	Well I don't- did that match?	
50	48		Oh, this one-
50	48		No ### does
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	Keep flipping	
50	48		Flip it over
50	48		Flip it over
50	48		Actually ### pieces ###
50	48	Can you get in? Here	
50	48	Better?	
50	48		Think this goes like-
50	48	Nice!	
50	48	That's another edge	
50	48	Hmm	
50	48		There's no s- *gasp* Spots!
50	48		
50	48	Does it go d- at the bottom?	
50	48	Did you find something?	
50	48		Spots
50	48	Mmm	
50	48		Spots!
50	48	I see that	
50	48		What is the-
50	48	What i- Are there other butterfly pieces that you see anywhere?	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	This one?	
50	48		That
50	48	Where do you think this one goes?	
50	48		I think this one goes-
50	48	Mmm, nope. Doesn't match	
50	48		Does it match here?
50	48	I don't know. *gasp* I think it does	
50	48	What about, any other butterfly pieces?	
50	48	That's an inside piece, so we'll have to wait and see. That might go like around here somewhere	
50	48		*gasp* I know where that goes
50	48	This doesn't have an edge though, right?	
50	48	Does it have a edge?	
50	48		*sigh* No
50	48	Okay we can hold on	
50	48	Do you see any other butterfly pieces?	
50	48	Oh that's an edge	
50	48	That's an edge piece	
50	48		But it doesn't fit. *gasp* I know where that goes
50	48	Okay. What about other butterfly pieces? Let's look for the blue butterfly pieces	
50	48	that's an inside piece	
50	48	Turn it	
50	48		Aah. That goes inside there!
50	48	Good, now where was that other inside piece you had?	
50	48	Hmm	
50	48	Hmm, maybe turn it?	
50	48	No, not yet. This looks like someone's nose	
50	48		*laughing* Yeah, I think so. *gasp* Wait
50	48	Huh	
50	48		Someone's nose *gasp*
50	48	Is there other pieces of his nose, or his mouth?	
50	48		That goes like- I think some of 'em can just ###
50	48	Okay	
50	48		Let's do this crocodile
50	48		*laughing*
50	48	A crocodile?	
50	48		Yeah I know. Crocodile
50	48		See, I told ya
50	48	Oh yeah! Where does that one go?	
50	48		Actually it doesn't have an edge
50	48	Yeah. that's an inside piece, so we put that like right here, 'cause it somewhere in here maybe?	
50	48		###
50	48		Oh, I think it goes right there
50	48	Does it go- No	
50	48		*gasp* I think there's- There's a little green
50	48	Yeah, but I don't know that it matches up	
50	48	Maybe, move it over, maybe over here?	
50	48	Is that like it?	
50	48		
50	48	Oh I think you're right	
50	48		He goes there
50	48	Does he go there?	
50	48		Oh! Can't!
50	48	Just slow down. These aren't- This is a new puzzle	
50	48		
50	48		### you know this doesn't go there
50	48	Yeah, I don't know- I wonder if we have this the right way	
50	48		It doesn't
50	48	Hmm	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48		Ants
50	48	You know what I think? I think this piece-	
50	48	Hold on	
50	48	I think this butterfly	
50	48	Goes up here	
50	48		And where does this go?
50	48		### see this
50	48	Yeah I don't know	
50	48	Is this right?	
50	48		No, it isn't
50	48	It isn't?	
50	48		Wait, you're right. It does
50	48	Maybe this goes-	
50	48		These
50	48		
50	48	Over here?	
50	48	*noises*	
50	48		There's ants ###
50	48		Did you know ants are allowed to come on the ### too?
50	48		
50	48		
50	48	Maybe the butterfly goes down here	
50	48		The butterfly doesn't go down there
50	48	I think he goes down here. Let's try him- Let's try it!	
50	48		No! He-
50	48		
50	48		Oh yeah *laughing* it does. Then where does that-
50	48	I don't know, let's find the last corner piece	
50	48	Is this a corner piece? Or, do you see any?	
50	48	*gasp*	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48		*laughing*
50	48	Oh you found the eyes, nice	
50	48		
50	48	Where do the eyes go? That was the eye piece	
50	48		Think that th-
50	48	This is the top of his head, right?	
50	48	No, does it fit? You can't make it fit	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48		Why
50	48	You can't make it fit	
50	48		*gasp* I think it goes like this
50	48		
50	48	###	
50	48	Aah you're right! Good job	
50	48	Nice	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	Okay	
50	48		
50	48		Oh you're right!
50	48	You got it! You did that, I didn't do it	
50	48		Yes you did. See this ###-
50	48	Do you see any m- other part of his nose?	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48		
50	48	Good job	
50	48		And where does this go?
50	48	I don't know, but I think this goes here, huh?	
50	48		
50	48		
50	48		I think this goes here
50	48	Umm, maybe right there?	
50	48		
50	48		*gasp*
50	48	Nice!	
50	48	Alright, so is there an ant that has an edge, do you see part of an ant that has an edge?	
50	48	Oh that's part of the butterfly	
50	48		*gasp* I'll put it right here
50	48		
50	48	Nice	
50	48		### that's where it goes
50	48		### *gasp*
50	48	Is that where it goes?	
50	48		Wait. This-
50	48		Does-
50	48		Go-
50	48		Almost here- There
50	48		
50	48	Nice	
50	48		See I told you it would ###
50	48	Is there any other part? *gasp*	
50	48		
50	48		
50	48	Yay! Good job	
50	48		There's a little purplish in there
50	48	There is a little purplish in there	
50	48		
50	48		
50	48	What do you think?	
50	48		There's a butterfly with ###
50	48	Yeah? Was this a good one?	
50	48		Yeah
50	48	Yeah?	
50	48		Whoa!
50	48	What do you wanna do, NAME, do you wanna finish?	
50	48		I wanna finish this
50	48		
50	48	What do you think? Are we almost finished?	
50	48		
50	48	You're pr- getting these pretty fast now	
50	48		
50	48	Is there one more piece down here with an ant or a log? Do you see an ant or a log?	
50	48		
50	48	Nice	
50	48		
50	48		Hey, I- I think I got it right
50	48	You think you got it?	
50	48		I think this goes somewhere
50	48		###
50	48	Mmm, You know what we need the al- we need to finish the alligator, right? Do you see alligator guys?	
50	48		###
50	48		
50	48	Nice. Good one. That was very good	
50	48		That's a snake
50	48	Oh is it a snake? You're right, it is a snake	
50	48		###
50	48	We were thinking it was an alligator before	
50	48	Flip	
50	48		It has a little whitish
50	48		
50	48	Yeah	
50	48	It does. Where's that frog?	
50	48		###
50	48		Frog?
50	48		Here it is
50	48	No, that's not an edge piece	
50	48		Is that
50	48	But it'll go somewhere around here	
50	48		Does it go here?
50	48	No, I think that that one goes over here	
50	48	'Cause that looks like part of the sloth. Whoa ### *noises*	
50	48	Nope	
50	48	Doesn't this look part of the sloth ###	
50	48		*gasp* No
50	48	Oh, here. Does it go here?	
50	48		Yeah
50	48	Nope	
50	48		Oh I think though
50	48	No	
50	48	Hmm. Oh, there it goes. Goes right there	
50	48		*gasp*
50	48		
50	48		This goes like this
50	48	Oh, okay	
50	48		So this goes-
50	48		Here
50	48	Nope, it's gotta have an edge. Remember? Let's finish the edges	
50	48		Oh
50	48	Here's two edges, right? And another edge?	
50	48		No, let's ### *gasp* I know where this goes
50	48	No, it's gotta go along the edge. So there's only three spots left for edges	
50	48		Edge
50	48		And there's more spots!
50	48	Those are inside spots	
50	48		Where ### that one
50	48		###
50	48	Nice	
50	48		
50	48		See I told you it had to be like that
50	48	Did it? You were right, you told me	
50	48		*laughing*
50	48	Where's the edge for up here?	
50	48		
50	48		I know where this goes
50	48	Oh good job	
50	48		That's his other piece of his ears. I found his other piece of ear
50	48	Mmm *noises*	
50	48		Wait
50	48		Hey
50	48	Does that go up here?	
50	48	No	
50	48		No. *gasp*
50	48		
50	48	Nice	
50	48		Told ya
50	48		Does it have to be like that
50	48	No, I think that you were right, I think these just need to line up	
50	48		They just have to line up
50	48		
50	48		They just have to line up, mom
50	48	They do, you're right	
50	48		
50	48	Good job!	
50	48		See? I told ya
50	48	Does he go there? I don't think he does	
50	48	The other frog must go somewhere down here	
50	48		
50	48	Oh, look	
50	48		His feet
50	48	His feet. Are there any other feet pieces?	
50	48		
50	48	Nice	
50	48		That's his arms
50	48	Yep	
50	48		
50	48	Last piece!	
50	48		
50	48		
50	48	Yay! Did it! Good job! Alright, you wanna go get *name*?	
50	48	Maybe she'll come	
50	48		
50	48	Yeah	
50	48	Yeah, we put the butterfly in the wrong place first, but that's okay. We figured it out	
50	48	Right?	
50	48	What do you think's next?	
50	24	*gasp* *noises*	
50	24		
50	24		We didn't have this puzzle
50	24	We don't have that one ###	
50	24		###
50	24	Nope	
50	24	No, you have one like this but it's fishing. You go fishing, and I think it's a similar scene	
50	24		I didn't- I di- Did you know there's-
50	24		Yeah and it's a hard- You can use your fingers to-
50	24	Are we gonna dump?	
50	24		No
50	24	No?	
50	24		See? It's easier to break out
50	24	It's easier to break 'em out?	
50	24		
50	24		Yeah, see?
50	24		You just have to use your finger
50	24	Okay	
50	24		To help them in your hands
50	24		Hey
50	24		Aah, look at the swordfish
50	24	Ooh	
50	24	Okay, what do you want to do first?	
50	24	Mix 'em up?	
50	24		First this one
50	24		This one goes up here. *gasp* Where does this one go?
50	24		
50	24	I don't know	
50	24		No
50	24		Oh
50	24		
50	24	Is that an edge, or an inside?	
50	24		Aah
50	24		Goes like this
50	24	Is it an edge piece or an inside piece?	
50	24		
50	24	'Kay	
50	24		Where does this go?
50	24	How do you know if it's an edge or an inside piece?	
50	24		'Cause I do
50	24	Mmm, is that a corner piece?	
50	24	Who is that? What- What are these?	
50	24		Octopus arms
50	24	Mmkay, and where's the octopus?	
50	24		Tentacles
50	24	Okay, so where do you think this piece goes?	
50	24		It has an edge
50	24	Okay	
50	24	But where's the octopus?	
50	24		There
50	24	Right, so how would you- how would you attach it to that octopus?	
50	24		*noises*
50	24	Woops! Uh-oh	
50	24		What is that? Is this a squid?
50	24	A piece fell	
50	24	I don't know, it might be	
50	24		###
50	24	Kinda looks squidish	
50	24	Right?	
50	24		Look
50	24		Purplish ###
50	24	Purplish. Okay, but let's finish the octopus	
50	24		
50	24		See, I told you
50	24	Where's the other octopus piece? Where was the one you just had?	
50	24		This one
50	24	Okay, where do you think that one goes?	
50	24		There
50	24		No
50	24		I don't know where it is
50	24		Those go
50	24	This is a flat side, right?	
50	24		This one doesn't have a flat side
50	24	Yeah?	
50	24		Did it
50	24	Nice	
50	24	Where does this piece go?	
50	24		Umm, I think here
50	24		
50	24		I was right!
50	24	Yeah, sometimes you gotta flip 'em, remember?	
50	24		*laughing* Yeah, I know Where does this go?
50	24	I don't know. Where is the squid?	
50	24		It has- here
50	24	An edge	
50	24		
50	24		It's not a squid
50	24		
50	24	It's not?	
50	24		No. See?
50	24	Oh, is it a-	
50	24	Anemone?	
50	24		An emany
50	24	*laughing*	
50	24		###
50	24		I mean an emany
50	24	An emany?	
50	24		Yeah, emany
50	24	Yeah, mommy can't say that word	
50	24		Em- emany
50	24	Who is this part of?	
50	24		###
50	24		Oh, that? That part of a shark!
50	24	It is	
50	24		
50	24	Oh my goodness. Alright, what other pieces are here?	
50	24		Um, this
50	24	Hmm	
50	24		Hmm
50	24	What does it have on it?	
50	24		The tail of that
50	24	Yeah?	
50	24		Well where does that go?
50	24	I don't know. We can hold on to it until-	
50	24		### Whoa! That, that, and that
50	24	Do you have another- you ###	
50	24	You need three more corner pieces. Where are your corner pieces?	
50	24		###
50	24		Here's my piece- Wait
50	24	Is that a corner piece?	
50	24		This
50	24	Mmm	
50	24	Close, but no cigar	
50	24	Good job	
50	24	Good! Who's this?	
50	24		That's a crab
50	24	Is it a crab?	
50	24		It is
50	24		Show you
50	24	Do these go together?	
50	24		I think so
50	24	Yeah	
50	24		*noises* I can't fit them
50	24		
50	24	You can	
50	24	Gotta go one at a time, remember? Just go slow	
50	24	Wait wait wait. Let's do the top one	
50	24		
50	24	There ya go	
50	24		This one's a seahorse
50	24		Does it go up here?
50	24	Does it go in the corner?	
50	24		*gasp* Look at that
50	24	What does it have on that- on that piece?	
50	24		
50	24		Does it go like this?
50	24	I'm not sure	
50	24		
50	24	*gasp* you got it	
50	24		I think this goes right- Aah, somewhere
50	24		
50	24	What's- There you go	
50	24	Do you have any other corner pieces?	
50	24	Go sl- Go slow, go slow. Do one side and then the other side, okay?	
50	24		*noises*
50	24		
50	24		I was right
50	24	These aren't like our puzzles, that have been used a lot	
50	24	Hmm, who is that part of?	
50	24		
50	24		*gasp* He has to watch out for that
50	24	Mmkay	
50	24		
50	24		*noises* I can't. Oh
50	24	There you go, that got in	
50	24		
50	24		Aah!
50	24	What's this piece?	
50	24		*laughing* Whoa, that's a hard one
50	24		
50	24		*noises*
50	24		###
50	24		
50	24		Let's do more that piece
50	24	You wanna do that one last?	
50	24		
50	24		Yeah
50	24	Yeah	
50	24		
50	24		
50	24	Nice job	
50	24		I'm gonna tell her
50	24	Okay	
50	24	Go tell her we were super fast on this one	
50	24		
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
51	24		
51	24	Turn the pieces over. Let's mix 'em up	
51	24	###	
51	24		
51	24		###
51	24	Mm-hmm, ###	
51	24	Okay	
51	24	### do the puzzle?	
51	24		Mommy do it with me
51	24	So look at the picture	
51	24	And so the shark is in the corner, and is that the jellyfish?	
51	24		Uh-huh
51	24	And, is that a whale? And a starfish	
51	24		Mm-hmm
51	24	So, jellyfish, shark, whale and starfish, so	
51	24		And that!
51	24	The seahorse, okay	
51	24		And the squid
51	24	And the squid. Okay, so we're ready?	
51	24		And the crab
51	24	Yeah, so-	
51	24	Let's to the puzzle. We can do it- I don't think we need to do it on here. We can just do it on here. That way we can look at this as a guide, okay?	
51	24		I think it's gonna get covered up
51	24		
51	24	No, we're ### on the table	
51	24	And so try to find all of the pieces	
51	24		Oh!
51	24	Okay	
51	24		Mmm
51	24	*Mm-hmm*	
51	24	Good, that goes together	
51	24	Good	
51	24		Mmm
51	24	I think that's up at the top, right?	
51	24	See the straight edge? So that's gonna go up at the top. Does that connect right there?	
51	24	Mmkay	
51	24	### the others	
51	24	Good	
51	24	You can probably try to find the seahorse body. That'd probably be easy	
51	24		###
51	24	Mm-hmm	
51	24	And what else?	
51	24		We need to find the face
51	24	Mm-hmm	
51	24	Or you can see what else might go with that purple piece	
51	24	That doesn't go there	
51	24	What color is the face, do you think?	
51	24	Oh that's good	
51	24		I don't think this is a type of animal
51	24	That's not an animal	
51	24	What color face do you think that has?	
51	24		I don't know
51	24	Blue?	
51	24	Look at the umm, example	
51	24		Yeah
51	24		
51	24	So you have to find a blue piece	
51	24		This is too small
51	24	Mm-hmm	
51	24	But look, see how this edge is straight? ### Straight end- straight edge for there. But you can see if it fits up here somewhere	
51	24		Mm-hmm
51	24		*noises*
51	24	Good	
51	24		Mmm, mom I can't find what goes there
51	24	###	
51	24	You need something that has a straight edge	
51	24	You wanna try to connect the orange? Maybe put the orange parts together	
51	24	That's good	
51	24		The bottom of the shark
51	24	Is it? Or it looks like an octopus. Or is that the shark? What is that? I don't know what that is	
51	24	*yeah, don't put that on your head, silly girl*	
51	24	Let's see	
51	24	Hmm, I see this eye Look. Does that go there?	
51	24		Mmm
51	24	Mm-hmm	
51	24	Good. That's a shark	
51	24		
51	24		What's that go in?
51	24	Mmm, I don't think that goes there	
51	24		The ###
51	24	Mm-hmm, where do you think this big orange piece goes?	
51	24		Mmm
51	24	Aah, that looks good. What is that, octopus	
51	24	Or a squid	
51	24		That's the squid
51	24	What is that, a squid?	
51	24		I don't think we have a octopus
51	24	Actually, I think it is an octopus, 'cause it has eight legs	
51	24	Yeah	
51	24		How do you know we can do it on the table?
51	24	Umm, because you can do puzzles on the table. And I wanted us to see the example, it makes it easier	
51	24		This doesn't look right
51	24	Mm-mm	
51	24		What goes here?
51	24	Oh, this might be the other piece, sorry	
51	24	Good	
51	24	Good	
51	24	*oh, you made a very tall tower, huh?*	
51	24	Oh, NAME let's finish your puzzle please. Aah, here we go	
51	24	Let's move this out of the way, because ### connect the puzzles	
51	24	Okay	
51	24	*It fell down? You can put it back up*	
51	24	Here, put this closer to you, too, 'cause there's some at the top too	
51	24	Good	
51	24	You see that pink?	
51	24	Where do you think that pink goes?	
51	24	Want me to help?	
51	24	### connect ###	
51	24	*Mm-hmm, I see*	
51	24	Good	
51	24	Just a few more	
51	24		Do you think that goes here
51	24	It might. What color is that?	
51	24	### something blue	
51	24	Good	
51	24	Look at the picture. Where do you see this ###	
51	24	Where do you think it goes?	
51	24		
51	24	Almost	
51	24	*mm-hmm*	
51	24	*yeah, that's good*	
51	24	Good job!	
51	24	*laughing* You did it, good job. Is it just like the picture?	
51	24	Very nice	
51	24	Okay	
51	24	Okay, let's go find her. *Uh-oh, let's pick this up*	
51	24	Let's see	
51	24	*Wait, let's pick up the blocks and take them to the next room*	
51	24	*name*	
51	24		Then can we play there?
51	24	*Pick up the blocks*	
51	24		Then can we play there with ###
51	24	**name* ### blocks over there	
51	24		Then can we play ###
51	24	### more puzzles to do	
51	24		No mom I don't want a puzzle
51	24	*name* go get those, um, blocks over there NAME you help too. ### *name*! stop that	
51	24		### lego blocks
51	24	Mm-hmm	
51	24		They're not just blocks because they're legos
51	24	Mm-hmm	
51	24		### blocks
51	24		### call them ### because ### big like a ###
51	24	Yep, mega-blocks	
51	24		And they're- And they have those sticky things that are like how lego blocks
51	24	*good job*	
51	24	Uh-oh	
51	24	Okay, let's go, yeah?	
51	24	Okay, come on	
51	24		*name*
51	24		
51	24		We have to play more
51	24	Yeah	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
51	48	This is neat, it's like ### animals	
51	48		Ooh
51	48		
51	48	Yeah, look. The red-eyed tree frog, and a jaguar, and is that a- What is that, a um, sloth?	
51	48		
51	48		Yeah
51	48	*mmkay*	
51	48		And a snake!
51	48	Yeah	
51	48		Whoa that snake has a very sharp teeth!
51	48	I know, ###	
51	48		###
51	48	Okay, *name*, alright let's turn this over, and get the pieces out	
51	48	Oh	
51	48	'Kay	
51	48	This one has a lot more pieces	
51	48	*Oh, *name* Why don't you go play with the blocks over there*	
51	48		*Yeah, this is too hard for you*
51	48		Mommy, this is too hard for *name*, right?
51	48	Yeah. This'll be challenging for us too, but we can do it	
51	48	###	
51	48		Why? Why is it challenging?
51	48	Well this has twice as many pieces	
51	48	And the colors-	
51	48		
51	48	Are all very similar	
51	48		But we can do it because we have the ###
51	48	*laughing* Yeah, we can do it	
51	48	Okay, and so- What-	
51	48	There we go	
51	48	###	
51	48	The butterfly	
51	48	Beautiful butterfly	
51	48	###	
51	48	*it's some ants*	
51	48	*some ants*	
51	48	Wow, you're getting right into it, NAME	
51	48	Wow! What made you start with the butterfly?	
51	48		Because
51	48	Hmm	
51	48		*laughing*
51	48	###	
51	48	Does that look right?	
51	48	No, I don't think so	
51	48		I think-
51	48	Maybe, scoot it- See how it's a straight edge? Line it up with the other straight edges	
51	48	See? That makes the border	
51	48	Okay. Look at the color, you see how it's pink there, and that's pink?	
51	48	That's part of his nose, so you can connect that, see?	
51	48		### the other part go here
51	48		
51	48	The butterfly, so we're looking for a blue?	
51	48	Aah	
51	48		Mommy, this isn't so tricky after all
51	48	Yeah, but I don't think that piece goes there. See how not really connected very well?	
51	48	And see look, this is brown, and that's green, I don't think that's supposed to go there. We'll have to hold on, hold on to that	
51	48		*laughing*
51	48	You got it?	
51	48		It's
51	48	Let me see. No, that doesn't fit. You had to kind of force it I bet	
51	48		Ooh! Oh!
51	48	Mm-hmm	
51	48		**name*, I can't see the draw-*
51	48	*Yeah, *name*, we can't- we're doing this with NAME, okay? So she can see the example*	
51	48	*Here, look *name* you wanna build a tower? Or something?*	
51	48	Mmkay	
51	48	Good	
51	48		*laughing*
51	48	Good, NAME	
51	48		
51	48	*Hmm?*	
51	48	Oh, that's a snake, huh?	
51	48	*What, *name*?*	
51	48		*laughing*
51	48	Good	
51	48	There's a piece of the jaguar. I don't know where that one goes, though. It's just a little spot	
51	48	Hmm	
51	48	Try it right here, there's like, room for a spot maybe?	
51	48	Yeah	
51	48	It's a beautiful jaguar	
51	48	Or cheetah? It's a jaguar or cheetah, it's either-	
51	48		I think it's a cheetah
51	48		Because jaguars have stripes
51	48	Jaguar- no. Jaguars have spots. Baby jaguar Diego has spots	
51	48	Mmkay	
51	48	*It's a flower*	
51	48	So, what are you gonna put together now?	
51	48	Oh, that's his ear?	
51	48	*Mmm, that's the snake's eye*	
51	48		I can't find out where it goes
51	48	Let me see. Maybe try- Try the other ear, maybe it doesn't go on this ear	
51	48	See?	
51	48		###
51	48	And that's another part of the jaguar, I mean the um, yeah	
51	48	And you can probably try to connect some red stuff there if you want to	
51	48	Good eye	
51	48		That's not the one that goes there
51	48	Yeah, ###	
51	48	*It's not scary*	
51	48		###
51	48	Mm-hmm	
51	48	*It's not scary*	
51	48	*Because it's not* You want- Are you looking for more red flowers?	
51	48	### flowers there too	
51	48		I can't find out which one goes-
51	48	### Does that one go ###	
51	48	*you wanna go? Where do you wanna go?*	
51	48		###
51	48	Mmm, that doesn't go	
51	48	*I don't have any gum, *name**	
51	48	Did you try this one?	
51	48		Yes
51	48	Did you try it on the edge? 'Cause that's a straight edge	
51	48	*Okay*	
51	48	*here*	
51	48	*You play with the blocks, *name**	
51	48	*You wanna play with my phone?*	
51	48	*I don't have a granola bar. Do you wanna play with my phone?*	
51	48	*Do you wanna play with my phone?*	
51	48	*Okay, have a seat. Let me get it*	
51	48		### can't find out which one to go
51	48	What about this one? Are you looking at the example? See how there's a frog on the red leaf?	
51	48		*laughing*
51	48	See?	
51	48	And then you can try to find more red that connects that one	
51	48		
51	48	Look at that flower, I think that flower goes at the bottom, ### it's a little bit different. See how it's different?	
51	48		###
51	48	I bet you can- Will it connect down here	
51	48		It won't connect there
51	48	Yeah, 'cause it's in the corner, over here	
51	48	We don't have those pieces yet	
51	48		Look this one has a berry
51	48	Mm-hmm. That's part of the, um, toucan. So that goes at the top up here somewhere	
51	48		That's-
51	48		Mommy, can't find the one that goes here
51	48	Let's see	
51	48		Mmm
51	48	Umm, is this one?	
51	48	See if that one goes there	
51	48	Yep	
51	48		And then what goes here?
51	48	So this- What does it look like? What's next?	
51	48		Snakey
51	48	Yeah, so find part of the snake body. Right there's the snake	
51	48	Here's part of the snake	
51	48	And remember, if it's a straight edge, you match up the straight edges	
51	48	*Mm-hmm*	
51	48	*Yeah?*	
51	48	*Okay, can I have that piece back?*	
51	48	*I see*	
51	48	*Thank you*	
51	48		Mommy, I can't find it
51	48	*Give me that puzzle piece, *name**	
51	48	Mmkay	
51	48		It's a straight edge but-
51	48	Yeah, so, you match it up. Turn it around, the straight edges go together	
51	48	See?	
51	48	That looks like an eye	
51	48		This is not a straight edge
51	48	No	
51	48	Good, you completed his eye	
51	48	You see more of the snake?	
51	48	Where's the snake head?	
51	48	Hmm	
51	48	Where is it? 	
51	48		Mmm, I don't know
51	48	Okay, well let's do a different piece	
51	48	We're missing part of the baby jaguar. Or the jaguar- here	
51	48		Or the big jaguar
51	48	This looks like it. You see the mushrooms?	
51	48		Mm-hmm
51	48	And then part of his mouth there?	
51	48	And then what's next, these mushrooms	
51	48		Yes
51	48	And so, maybe try to find some more mushrooms and ants?	
51	48		Mmm
51	48	'Member? Straight edges	
51	48	Find some more mushrooms and ants	
51	48	See, that's not a straight edge, it doesn't fit ###	
51	48		Mommy, I don't know what ### goes here
51	48	You see the green?	
51	48		Mmm
51	48	Do you think, maybe it connects to this green right here, and that part of the mushroom	
51	48		Mmm, Mmm
51	48		No
51	48	Mm-mm	
51	48		I think that connects to this
51	48	Maybe, try it and see	
51	48		No, look. Look
51	48	Hmm, no I don't think so	
51	48		###
51	48	Yeah, well it looks like this is another piece of the ant	
51	48		
51	48		It doesn't go here
51	48		Look. Look!
51	48	No	
51	48		This puzzle is too tricky!
51	48	It's a little bit tricky, but you can do it	
51	48		'Cause I completed the butterfly
51	48	Mm-hmm. And you did that really quickly	
51	48	###	
51	48	So, there- We've gotta be able to put this together. Look	
51	48		I need something
51	48	You wanna try to connect the ants? And see if that connects there?	
51	48	And what does this look like?	
51	48		This
51	48	Yeah, but that's at the bottom, so that probably won't fit, but there's some more red plants though, right?	
51	48		###
51	48		Mommy, what's this?
51	48	NAME, do you need to use the bathroom?

51	48	And then this ### connect	
51	48	See, all you gotta do is put 'em together	
51	48	There. And there might be another red piece here	
51	48	I found another red piece	
51	48		
51	48	And what's this orange thing?	
51	48	Another flower, right? Do you see, ### another flower, so maybe connect more of the orange flower	
51	48		Mmm
51	48	But that one doesn't have a straight edge, so that can't be it	
51	48	Do you see another f- um, orange flower?	
51	48		Mm-hmm
51	48	Mm-hmm	
51	48	But that's not a straight edge, so that can't work	
51	48		It's sticking
51	48	Yeah, it sticks, but we know it's not right, because it has to have a straight edge	
51	48	Look for another orange, with a straight edge

8	48	We have to mess 'em all up because you can't know where it goes	
8	48	What's the fun of that?	
8	48	Right? We have to start from scratch	
8	48	So what do we usually do when we start a puzzle?

8	48	Okay, let's build around it, let's bui-	
8	48		This is too hard
8	48	No, does that look like it goes there? No, see how the purple matches with each- No, that's orange next to it. So that doesn't match, okay?	
8	48	What else can we try?	
8	48		Uh, It goes there!
8	48	No it doesn't	
8	48		Yes it does
8	48	There's orange right there and there's blue right there so that doesn't go. Does it go on this side?	
8	48		Mmm, No
8	48	Yes it does	
8	48		
8	48	Okay, does this match on some of the sides? There's only two sides. There's this side with the green-

8	48	NAME, stand up, Okay?	
8	48	Okay, you keep on trying to put something in there. See how this has to match this part?	
8	48	And this has to match this part. So you think this goes in here?	
8	48		Ah
8	48	NAME don't worry about the chair	
8	48		These chairs!
8	48	I know, it's for adults, it's not for kids. That's why	
8	48	Does this go in here, does it look like it matches?	
8	48		Yeah
8	48	Why does it match?	
8	48		Because. *noises* *whining*
8	48	'Cause why?	
8	48	Okay, alright, so, Okay	
8	48		*sigh*
8	48	How else do we start a puzzle? Like take all the e- the ones with the flat sides, and this, what, doesn't this look like it would go in a corner?	
8	48	Does it go in that corner?	
8	48	Does it go in this corner?	
8	48		Mm-hmm
8	48	Does it go in this corner? It's upside-down, no	
8	48		Mm-hmm
8	48	Does it go in this corner? No, so it has to go in that corner, right?	
8	48		Yes!
8	48		No
8	48	Okay, let's see if you find any flat pieces	
8	48	See if you find any other flat pieces, Oh, this one has a flat side, right?

8	48	No	
8	48	No	
8	48		I can't
8	48	This flat side goes against the corner. So how does it go?	
8	48		
8	48	There you go. How do you put a puzzle together- How do you put the pieces- There you go, so there! 'Kay? Find me some more with the flat ends

8	48	Okay, which one does this look like? Does this look like this over here?	
8	48	Put these together? They look kind of alike? Okay. Find me some more flat sides	
8	48	No, that's not a flat side	
8	48		*noises*
8	48	This one's a flat side. Does it look like the frog over here? Look at the frog with the flowers. See the frog with the flowers? Doesn't it look like that matches?	
8	48		Yeah
8	48	Okay let's put it over there, Goes somewhere	
8	48		*sigh*
8	48	Mmm, nope. It doesn't quite fit there. See, that doesn't match, right?	
8	48	Maybe it goes on this side?	
8	48	There we go, see? It completed the leaf, See that piece? It completed the rest of the flower	
8	48	Mmm, no I don't think so	
8	48	I think if we have to find a piece it has to be green and pink	
8	48		Are we gonna stay all day and do this?
8	48	NAME, No we're not. Now listen, do these two match? Lookit. Lookit these two, see lookit they don't match

8	48		I can't
8	48	Then look at this one. Here's the other corner piece. See? Corner, corner	
8	48	'Member the two flat sides have the corner?	
8	48		
8	48	You're not gonna get a pri- When she asks you if you want something at the end you're not gonna get one, 'cause you're not cooperating	
8	48		Okay, now I am
8	48	Okay, does that match? No	
8	48	Where does the flat side have to go on? The flat side has to go on the end, right? So maybe does it go like this?	
8	48		*sigh*
8	48		*noises*
8	48	There, see how it connects? See how that's the end of the plant? Where do you think this one goes? The flat end goes on the end, right? Do you think it goes there?	
8	48		Ye- Ye- Yeah
8	48	Okay, well try and put it in there	
8	48	There you go	
8	48	Look at this we got it ###	
8	48	Where do you think this one goes? This goes on the flat end? You think it goes there?	
8	48		*noises*

8	48	Look at this, does this look like it'll fit there?	
8	48	No	
8	48	Does this look like it'll fit? No, it doesn't have a flat end. Let's find one with a flat end that looks like it'll fit right in that space	
8	48	You see any?	
8	48	You see any?	
8	48	You getting tired now? Well maybe you can take a nap in the car on the way home. 'Cause it's Saturday night. You stay up late 'cause ###

8	48	Maybe it goes over here	
8	48		Then why is this here?
8	48		
8	48	I don't know, let's see if we can figure it-. Does that fit in there? No	
8	48	Oh no we've gotta find more with a flat end that go next to this	
8	48		*noises*
8	48	Lookit	
8	48	What's a flat end	
8	48	This one maybe? No, that doesn't fit, lookit. That doesn't fit, right?

8	48		*noises*

8	48		*noises*
8	48	Hmm, I don't see another flat piece that could possibly fit into here	
8	48	Okay let's start on this corner. 'Kay, so we have this corner together, right?	
8	48	Do we see any other pictures that look like this?	
8	48	C'mon NAME

8	48		*noises*
8	48	Hmm. Nope, not quite	
8	48	Where's the rest of the flat ones?	
8	48	No. We gotta find the flat ones first so we can make the outline	
8	48		*whining*
8	48	### outline a little easier	
8	48	What if this all goes down here	
8	48	This looks like over here, right?

8	24	Where's the corner of the puzzle? Where's the corner? point to it	
8	24		
8	24	Is this the corner?

8	24	What did I tell you about the two flat sides? Goes in the corner	
8	24		
8	24	There we go

8	24	*gasp* See, you can do it. I told you	
8	24		
8	24	Okay, now, this is a corner	
8	24	This is not a corner. So find something that you think would match on the flat	
8	24		### Is this the corner
8	24	It's not a corner, see? It's got- it doesn't have a flat end ### It doesn't go	
8	24		
8	24	Now what do you think would connect in between here? Something with a f- with the end flat, something with brown on one side. No.	
8	24	Brown on one side	
8	24	Brown	
8	24	And then this color. Nope	
8	24	How does th- The flat side goes on the end	
8	24	Flat side goes on the end	
8	24	There ya go	
8	24

8	24	The corner's got the two flat sides, right? Where does the corner go, in the corner?	
8	24		
8	24	Okay, now what can connect? Do you think that connects to the end of the swordfish?	
8	24	Let's see	
8	24	Let's see

8	24	I think it connects! Okay now we gotta find the ones that go here	
8	24	Nope, a flat side, a flat side	
8	24	Something with a flat side	
8	24	Flat. A flat side's gotta go on there	
8	24	Flat	
8	24	Nope, this doesn't go next to it. It's gotta be two sides that are flat. So put the flat side	
8	24	What goes here? What do you think goes there?	
8	24	Not this one yet. You gotta go on the flat side first, and then we can put these in the middle	
8	24	Think that goes there?	
8	24		Yep
8	24	Okay, now find the other one with the flat side	
8	24		
8	24	And it should go on the side	
8	24	Flat	
8	24		Is this it?
8	24		
8	24	Yeah, that's got the flat side, right?	
8	24	No, the flat side goes on the wall	
8	24	Nope

8	24	Does that look like that belongs there?	
8	24		No
8	24	Doesn't pink belong up there?	
8	24	Doesn't pink belong up there? There's pink. Which one's got pink?	
8	24	Okay, no, pink it up and try again	
8	24		
8	24	There you go, there you go. Okay, only one place for that!
