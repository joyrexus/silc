2	NF	85.02	86.25	1.23		what do you think about this.		
2	NF	86.79	91.64	4.85		since the moon has no air or water, there would be no plants or animals there.		
2	NF	92.2	93.18	0.98		cause why?		
2	NF	93.33	99.14	5.81			because plants need water and animals also need water.	
2	NF	99.12	101.75	2.63		mm-hmm, and they need air too, right, to breathe?		
2	NF	102.38	103.31	0.93				page 5

2	NF	145.01	145.81	0.8				page 7
2	NF	147.15	152.95	5.8		each time, two astronauts stepped onto the moon's surface. look at the suits they got to wear.		
2	NF	153.56	155.32	1.76		do you know why they had to wear that suit?		
2	NF	155.46	155.98	0.52			why?	
2	NF	156.91	161.09	4.18		there's no air on the moon right? so what would happen if they didn't have their own air?		
2	NF	162.955	164.075	1.12			they would die.	
2	NF	164.0	175.85	11.85		yeah. so this, do you see that big tank thing on the back, that had air in it and so they would breathe with that and this would keep all the air inside by them instead of just escaping		
2	NF	178.18	178.95	0.77				page 8
2	NF	183.64	188.64	5.0		astronauts wore spacesuits. spacesuits gave astronauts air to breathe.

2	NF	219.52	221.68	2.16		what was the guy on the wall?		
2	NF	222.28	223.23	0.95		what was the guy doing?		
2	NF	223.79	226.83	3.04			holding him since there's no gravity?	
2	NF	226.72	230.8	4.08		he had him on one finger, right, right so there's no gravity so he floats		
2	NF	230.41	231.15	0.74				page 10
2	NF	232.35	234.85	2.5			yeah he's not very strong.	
2	NF	234.71	239.87	5.16		no he wasn't that strong. it would be easy even for you to lift me up, on the way		
2	NF	240.43	241.83	1.4			what's that noise?	
2	NF	240.61	242.71	2.1		I think that's just the heater.

2	NF	271.83	275.34	3.51		about every four weeks, and four weeks make up one...		
2	NF	278.35	280.41	2.06		one... month.		
2	NF	281.01	287.72	6.71		so every four weeks or about every month the moon travels around the earth. so we're going, the earth is going around what.

2	NF	299.55	302.18	2.63		the sun shines on the moon and lights it up.		
2	NF	302.32	305.33	3.01		right? cause the moon doesn't really give off its own light.		
2	NF	306.41	308.89	2.48		right? it reflects the sun's light?		
2	NF	307.84	310.32	2.48			it's the bestest feeling.	
2	NF	309.29	310.22	0.93				page 12
2	NF	312.28	314.11	1.83			that's why you can't see it.	
2	NF	314.21	315.83	1.62		well you can see it.		
2	NF	316.23	317.91	1.68			can see it.

2	NF	333.18	336.78	3.6			some nights the moon is half moon.	
2	NF	335.753	337.393	1.64		cause it's half of that.		
2	NF	339.673	340.423	0.75				page 14
2	NF	339.88	343.56	3.68			other nights, the moon is just a crescent moon.	
2	NF	342.853	345.023	2.17		mm-hmm, just a sliver in the sky.		
2	NF	346.35	347.25	0.9				page 15

2	NF	368.3	373.12	4.82			um... finding other astronauts?	
2	NF	373.01	376.51	3.5		finding other astronauts? I think it would be fun to bounce around.		
2	NF	376.85	380.18	3.33		and do somersaults in the air because there's no gravity.		
2	NF	379.81	382.49	2.68			it would be fun to do that.	
2	NF	380.49	381.94	1.45		or very little gravity.		
2	NF	382.38	384.8	2.42		there's some gravity, just not as much right?		
2	NF	385.48	388.29	2.81			uh huh, so you could still float.	
2	NF	388.27	389.02	0.75		uh-huh.

8	NF	308.38	309.36	0.98				page 10
8	NF	308.82	309.25	0.43			how?

16	NF	203.27	204.73	1.46		it was almost like floating		
16	NF	206.25	207.27	1.02		why's that		
16	NF	207.45	209.24	1.79			cause there's no gravity	
16	NF	209.71	213.36	3.65		there's just less gravity because the moon is smaller than the earth		
16	NF	213.59	217.24	3.65		and the smaller the planet, the less gravity there is		
16	NF	217.28	220.14	2.86		so is there more gravity on jupiter or on earth		
16	NF	220.98	221.87	0.89			jupiter	
16	NF	221.89	222.8	0.91		definitely		
16	NF	222.56	223.54	0.98				page 10
16	NF	223.39	225.13	1.74		cause it's so much bigger than the earth		
16	NF	226.2	228.98	2.78			so you can't jump on jupiter?	
16	NF	229.08	236.55	7.47		probably not, I think that if we were on jupiter, we would be crushed by the gravity		
16	NF	236.89	240.6	3.71		there'd be so much gravity we might not be able to peel ourselves up		
16	NF	241.177	241.877	0.7		although	
16	NF	243.147	245.927	2.78		jupiter is a great big gas planet giant	
16	NF	246.227	246.907	0.68			yeah
16	NF	246.927	250.577	3.65		I think that it has, at the very center at its core it's solid	
16	NF	251.497	256.187	4.69		but most of it is gas, and it's not gases we can breathe either	
16	NF	257.747	259.717	1.97		so there's not really any place to stand	
16	NF	260.437	266.037	5.6		from the moon, the astronauts could see earth. the earth looked far away	
16	NF	271.097	273.307	2.21		what do you think about that picture of the earth	
16	NF	273.91	275.49	1.58		you can only see half of it	
16	NF	276.29	277.04	0.75			yeah
16	NF	279.14	280.64	1.5		where's the other half?	
16	NF	282.3	284.21	1.91		it's in the shadow of the moon	
16	NF	284.21	285.39	1.18		yeah probably	
16	NF	288.01	290.11	2.1		amazing, why is it so blue	
16	NF	290.71	292.93	2.22			because there's so much water
16	NF	292.43	295.39	2.96		there's so much water think about it, three quarters of the earth is water	
16	NF	293.97	294.83	0.86				page 11
16	NF	295.29	295.8	0.51			yes

16	NF	302.66	305.1	2.44		the sun shines on the moon and lights it up		
16	NF	306.86	308.34	1.48		here's the sun		
16	NF	309.44	315.31	5.87		and here's, it's showing you how the moon travels around the earth it orbits the earth		
16	NF	315.66	318.7	3.04		right and the sun always shines on the same side of it		
16	NF	319.46	323.04	3.58		as it goes around so we always see the same side of the moon in the sky		
16	NF	323.24	326.12	2.88		but what about when we were down in argentina		
16	NF	326.34	329.27	2.93		in the southern hemisphere, what's different about the moon down there		
16	NF	329.69	333.62	3.93			because the moon blocks the sun	
16	NF	334.62	339.32	4.7		will we still see that same side of the moon in south america as we do up here in north america?		
16	NF	339.44	343.71	4.27		so when we lived in buenos aires, we saw the same side of the moon		
16	NF	345.91	347.47	1.56		but it was upside down		
16	NF	347.66	348.39	0.73			yes	
16	NF	348.66	354.16	5.5		or at least it looked upside down compared to how it looks in the northern hemisphere

16	NF	355.2	356.33	1.13				page 12

16	NF	400.92	403.75	2.83		you think maybe, maybe someday you can		
16	NF	410.44	413.12	2.68		looks like she's trying on one of the astronaut's helmets		
16	NF	421.78	427.37	5.59			it's even bigger than her head it's like going down covering her neck	
16	NF	427.57	430.73	3.16			but ## neck off really like this	
16	NF	430.81	436.0	5.19		well let's look at the picture of the astronaut

16	NF	436.28	436.86	0.58				page 8

16	NF	439.91	448.05	8.14		he's got extra flaps, over in here it is. it's pretty big, of course he's bigger than she is I think		
16	NF	443.2	443.81	0.61				page 7
16	NF	448.28	452.28	4.0		because he's a grown man and she looks like a young girl

16	NF	452.23	453.77	1.54			yeah she's a young girl	
16	NF	453.87	456.24	2.37		so I think that he's bigger than she is		
16	NF	457.29	462.18	4.89		and then, I bet his helmet doesn't fit really tightly around his neck anyway		
16	NF	457.57	458.24	0.67				page 7
16	NF	464.3	467.13	2.83		that looks bigger than how I would expect his head to be

20	NF	897.395	906.645	9.25		no, they're talking about the landscape of the moon it's got mountains, just like on earth, then it's got flat plains too	
20	NF	906.5	907.72	1.22			what's a plain
20	NF	908.17	909.98	1.81		you know, like a flat area	
20	NF	910.535	911.825	1.29		instead of hilly	
20	NF	911.2	914.93	3.73			I know, like a flat airplane
20	NF	916.125	917.045	0.92		kind of	
20	NF	917.535	920.525	2.99		like, kind of like the park. you know how it's pretty flat

20	NF	922.53	923.75	1.22				page 3
20	NF	922.56	924.53	1.97		that would be like a, I would call that a plain		
20	NF	924.345	929.845	5.5			there's only one two three four five six hills	
20	NF	930.625	931.295	0.67		mm-hmm

20	NF	949.13	950.8	1.67		yeah, lots of craters		
20	NF	950.9	957.41	6.51		I think that's why sometimes people say the moon, it's just a joke, but, that the moon could be made of cheese		
20	NF	958.25	959.26	1.01			that's made of	
20	NF	958.27	961.4	3.13		does it look kind of like swiss cheese, the cheese with the holes in it

20	NF	978.285	979.285	1.0				page 4
20	NF	979.87	983.49	3.62		since the moon has no air or water		
20	NF	981.985	987.905	5.92			the real moon is made out of cheese but the real moon is made out of rock	
20	NF	984.69	985.29	0.6		no		
20	NF	988.675	993.955	5.28		the bru-- yeah on cartoons it can be made out of cheese but not in real life

26	F	70.851	72.204	1.353		Well, maybe he's just playing		
26	F	72.864	75.636	2.772		I don't see the rocket, but maybe we'll see it soon

37	NF	124.575	125.235	0.66				Page 7
37	NF	125.895	131.307	5.412		Each time, two astronauts stepped onto the moon's surface		
37	NF	132.363	133.848	1.485		See what he's wearing?		
37	NF	134.805	135.762	0.957			What's that?	
37	NF	135.63	138.963	3.333		That's a special, um, like a helmet		
37	NF	139.92	153.021	13.101		Because, remember there's no air on the moon. They just can't- astronauts can't go - - they can't breathe in air, the way we do here, so they have to have a special suit that has the air inside of it, for them to breathe		
37	NF	153.318	153.879	0.561			Oh	
37	NF	153.879	155.727	1.848		It's kinda like when you go SCUBA diving

37	NF	156.651	165.528	8.877		There's no- You can't breathe under the water, so you have to take your own air to breathe, under the water, and you have to take your own air to breathe up to the moon, or in outer-space

37	NF	172.425	182.589	10.164		Special boots, 'cause there's also very little gravity, so when he takes- if he jumps, he would jump up very high		
37	NF	184.008	186.219	2.211		'Cause the gravity doesn't pull him back down		
37	NF	187.803	190.146	2.343		So they have to wear special heavy boots		
37	NF	191.664	194.007	2.343		So they don't go floating off into space		
37	NF	194.304	194.832	0.528			Oh?	
37	NF	194.898	195.756	0.858		Mm-hmm

37	NF	215.688	216.513	0.825				Page 9
37	NF	216.48	223.509	7.029		Astronauts could jump higher on the moon than they could on Earth. That's what I was- Exactly what I was saying		
37	NF	223.938	224.565	0.627			Oh	
37	NF	225.258	233.112	7.854		See, when you jump here, you jump up, you come right back down, because of gravity. It pulls you back down to the- to the floor- to the ground. 		
37	NF	232.848	233.343	0.495			Oh	
37	NF	233.508	241.527	8.019		But on the moon, the same gravity's not there. When they jump up, they go *noises* it's almost like being on a trampoline		
37	NF	241.989	242.583	0.594			Oh	
37	NF	242.286	244.035	1.749		Wouldn't that be neat? To try?		
37	NF	244.464	245.058	0.594			Oh	
37	NF	246.18	253.671	7.491		Okay, so they jump- They jump up higher, and they come down more slowly. It was almost like floating		
37	NF	254.067	254.859	0.792				Page 10
37	NF	254.562	256.41	1.848		I would love to try that sometime		
37	NF	256.872	264.858	7.986		From the moon, astronauts could see Earth. That's what our planet Earth looks like when you stand on the moon		
37	NF	264.957	265.518	0.561			Oh	
37	NF	265.386	266.673	1.287		Isn't it pretty?

37	NF	273.405	281.325	7.92		About every four weeks, the moon travels around Earth. So this is what the moon does.		
37	NF	281.919	295.35	13.431		It goes all around our Earth, where we live. When we look up in the sky, we see the moon, as it travels around our planet. The sun shines on the moon, and lights it up. So here, look.		
37	NF	295.845	299.574	3.729		Here's the sun, and depending on where the moon is-		
37	NF	300.828	302.775	1.947		Okay, it's not time for spinning around		
37	NF	303.237	306.075	2.838		Depending on where the moon is, it lights it up differently		
37	NF	306.504	309.507	3.003		So when we see a full moon, it gets a lot of the sun		
37	NF	310.266	318.78	8.514		All of the sun that- that shines on it. Other times it just gets part of it, so when it's a tiny crescent moon, it just reflects a tiny bit of the sun		
37	NF	319.968	320.76	0.792				Page 12
37	NF	320.067	320.991	0.924			###	
37	NF	320.793	326.7	5.907		That’s why you can see it. When you see it as a bright circle, it’s called a full moon		
37	NF	329.241	330.957	1.716		That's a big moon, isn't it?		
37	NF	331.287	332.013	0.726			Yeah	
37	NF	331.65	336.336	4.686		Sometimes it looks big and sometimes it looks small. Some nights the moon is a half-moon

37	NF	336.666	340.296	3.63		Just half of the moon is- is lit up by the sun's light

37	NF	386.958	394.053	7.095		I can't tell if that's a design on what she's wearing, or if it's a design on the spacesuit. It's probably her shirt

37	F	563.31	573.144	9.834		On and on they flew, up and up, above the clouds, past millions of stars, until at last they landed on the moon		
37	F	574.794	575.52	0.726				Page 9
37	F	576.444	578.919	2.475		There's nobody around here Said Baby Bear

37	F	604.131	605.352	1.221			No way!	
37	F	605.154	609.609	4.455		*laughing* I don't think they actually can. I think it's just the picture in the book

37	F	691.614	700.062	8.448		“I found a rocket”, said Baby Bear “And then I flew to the moon.” “Oh, my, what will you think of next!” said Mrs. Bear
