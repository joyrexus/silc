Joanna Schiffman is requesting multiple reports for four different transcript
collections.

She sent the following files (see the `excel` directory):

* `puzzle.xlsx` - `Entire Puzzle Transcript Language Analysis_June2014_updated.xlsx`

* `puzzle-15.xlsx` - originally `15 minute Puzzle Transcripts Language Analysis_June 2014_updated.xlsx`

* `puzzle-12.xlsx` - `12Piece_compiledtranscripts_June2014.xlsx`

* `book.xlsx` - `Entire Book Transcript Language Analysis_June2014.xlsx`

* `words.xlsx` - `Puzzle Lab Word List Spreadsheet_Spatial and Non 6-5-14.xlsx`


#### Joanna Schiffman's email request

**Jun 11, 2014**

You did some language counts for us in early March for the SILC puzzle lab study. I wanted to talk with you about getting some more counts and pulling out spatial words and utterances.

I have attached four transcript spreadsheets. The "15 minute puzzle transcripts...." and "Entire Puzzle Transcript..." are in the same format as each other and are just longer versions of what I sent you last time. 

The "Entire Book Transcript..." spreadsheet is similar, except that instead of 24 or 48 piece puzzle, the second column (book) has the labels F or NF (fiction or nonfiction). 

The "12 Piece...." is a little different. This one does not have time stamps and it is between the experimenter and the child, whereas the other two are between the parent and the child. I have a few different things I am going to ask you do--could you please do them for each spreadsheet separately? 

In addition, I have attached "Puzzle Lab Word List Spreadsheet...." This is basically the same word list I sent you last time, with a few words excluded. However, every word has now been labelled as either "Spatial or Non" and has been put in one of 12 categories. For all of the output you give us, when you list each word, could you also list whether it is spatial or non and what category it is in?

There are a few things we are hoping you can do for us.

First, can you create a spreadsheet where you pull out each word on our list, the utterance it was in, and the time stamp. This is not something you have done for this study before. I would like the spreadsheet to have the following columns: 

Subject
Puzzle/Book [12, 24, 48,  F, or NF]
Timestamp
Speaker [E, P or C]
Word
Spatial/Non
Category
Utterance


We would also like the types and token counts you have done for us in the past. 
We would like to know how many times (tokens) each speaker, per activity (book or puzzle), says each word. The spreadsheet should have the following columns



ID

Puzzle/Book 

Speaker

Match

Spatial/Non

Category

Count



The spatial/non and category columns are the only ones that will be different from the last time you did this, and as I said before, this will just be based on how we categorized the words in the word list spreadsheet.



In addition, last time you made a pivot table where you had rows for each word on our list and columns for each speaker per puzzle (i.e. 2-24-C). Could you please make one of these again? Again, if you could just add in two columns that will label whether each word is spatial/non and what category it is in, that would be great.



Finally, we would like to get total types and tokens counts for all words (not just the words in our list) for each speaker per puzzle/book. The columns you had in the spreadsheet last time were ID, Puzzle, Speaker, Word_Type, Work_Tok, Patt_Type, Patt_Tok. We would like all these counts again. In addition, could you give us total types and tokens counts for all words that are "spatial" and "Non" and all words in each of our categories?



Just to summarize, there are 16 documents I would like: PATTERN-TOTAL, PATTERN-15, PATTERN-12Piece, PATTERN-BOOK, PIVOT-TOTAL, PIVOT-15, PIVOT-12Piece, PIVOT-BOOK, SUMMARY-TOTAL, SUMMARY-15, SUMMARY-12Piece SUMMARY-BOOK, and then a spreadsheet with each word/utterance pulled out for TOTAL, 15, 12Piece, and BOOK.  



From all analyses, will you please exclude all language that is within * *? Also, there are capital letters used in these transcripts--I remember  you had to make everything lower case last time.
