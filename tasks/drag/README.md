# Drag

Here we're piloting a simple task in which items can be dragged to different regions of the screen.

    Talia and I are beginning a new study and are really interested in incorporating an ipad game into it so Susan suggested we talk to you. The game would be very simple - children would be asked to drag different numbers of objects into a box on the screen (I've attached an example that we made in powerpoint). We would probably want to have multiple trials with different types of objects and on some trials there would be multiple boxes. So the only thing we would need the program to be able to do is switch trials and allow the child to move objects. Let me know how feasible you think something like this might be.

    It might be helpful in the future to have a program that can record the final placement of the objects but definitely not necessary. Also, we're not even sure children will be able to do a task like this so we should probably pilot the simplest version before building something complicated.

    So I think all we need is for the objects to be able to move when they're dragged - no need for highlighting or a trail or anything. I think it would be good for objects to be capable of being dragged over one another.

    And then the only other thing we would need would be a way to change slides.

    It would be nice if there was an option for us to change the order or just a way for us to flip back and forth to different slides. Another function that would be helpful would be something that allows us to reset a given slide (so that we can repeat a trial on the same page). Let me know what you think.
