# README

Eliza, Neon, and Miriam are are interested in giving the subjects of their
study a web-based web-based follow-up task.

The task consists of a sequence of simple equations (single-variable first-degree polynomials) to be solved by the subject.

The equations are to be presented statically, each soliciting a single answer
response (i.e., the subject's solution to the equation presented).

Along with each response, they would like to know the time interval between when the equation/stimuli was presented and when the subject submitted their answer.

* problem - number of the problem in the sequence
* response - subject's response
* duration - time until response

The following information should be recorded along with the submitted responses (and their deliberation durations):

* subject - subject ID
* date - date and time (when task was initiated)
* duration - total time spent on task


## Task Presentation

The initial frame will contain directions for parents.

Then, the following stimuli are to be presented in sequence (frame by frame):

* 4 + 7 + 5 = __ + 5
* 4 + 7 + 5 = 24 + 5
* 2 + 6 + 7 = __ + 7
* 2 + 6 + 7 = __ + 7
* 5 + 4 + 3 = 5 + __
* 6 + 5 + 8 = 6 + __
* 3 + 7 + 9 = __ + 9
* 2 + 3 + 8 = 2 + __
* 6 + 2 + 4 = __ + 6
* 7 + 2 + 5 = 2 + __
* 2 + 6 + 3 = __ + 8
* 4 + 3 + 6 = 5 + __
* 2 x 3 x 4 = __ x 4
* 5 x 2 x 6 = 5 x __

After being presented with above stimuli, subject's will be presented with a
concluding frame and input form for optional feedback:

Great job! You are done with the study. The next page shows all the problems you worked on in case you want to talk about them with your parents. You can close this window at any time.
